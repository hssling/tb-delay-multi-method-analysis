Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript titled **"Precision Synthesis of Tuberculosis Detection Delays in India: A Unified Bayesian, PCA, and DAG Framework"** for consideration as an Original Article in IJMR. The study fuses five delay datasets (2023–2025) with national surveillance indicators and delivers reviewer-ready uncertainty intervals using a transparent code pipeline.

Key contributions include a national total detection delay of **31.3 days** (95% HDI 21.8–41.1), structural decomposition where the first three principal components explain **79.2%** of determinant variance, and a causal DAG covering eight variables and twelve pathways. Composite scoring highlights **Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal** as the highest-need jurisdictions for synchronized patient- and system-delay interventions.

All analyses rely on publicly available data; no human participants were contacted. The manuscript adheres to IJMR formatting (double-spaced DOCX with superscript references) and is below the journal’s word limits, with blinded and complete versions enclosed.

I confirm that the work is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and that all authors approve the submission. I authorize IJMR to manage the review process and am available for any clarifications.

Sincerely,  
**Dr H S Siddalingaiah**
