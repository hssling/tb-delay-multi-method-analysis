The feasibility, enablers, challenges and utility of implementing this modified metric through TB Champions (TB survivors) for HHC management were assessed. This was an explanatory mixed-methods study with a cohort design (quantitative) followed by a descriptive design with focus group discussions (qualitative). The study was conducted within routine programmatic settings in public health facilities in six districts from three states of India. In total, 595 drug-susceptible index pulmonary TB patients registered for treatment in the selected health facilities, and their listed 2108 HHCs were included in the study between December 2022 and August 2023. All 17 TB Champions involved in implementation participated in the focus group discussions. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of eligible participants receiving the desired service within the '7-1-7' timeliness metric and challenges in achieving the timeliness metrics. In 89% of 595 index patients, their HHCs were line-listed within 7 days of initiating anti-TB treatment ('First-7'). In 90% of 2108 HHCs, screening outcomes were ascertained within 1 day of line-listing ('Next-1'). In 42% of 2073 HHCs eligible for further evaluation, anti-TB treatment, TB preventive treatment (TPT) or a decision to not receive medication were made within 7 days of screening ('Second-7'). Barriers to TPT uptake included lack of money and daily wage losses for travelling to clinics, reluctance of asymptomatic contacts to take medication and fear of adverse events. TB Champions felt timeliness metrics improved performance in the systematic and timely management of HHCs. TB Champions found '7-1-7' timeliness metrics were feasible and useful, and national TB programmes should consider their operationalisation.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
41209996,Strategic Leverage Points in Implementing India's Nikshay Poshan Yojana for Tuberculosis Patients: A Scoping Review.,Cureus,2025,Arjun B; Chaitra Cm; Ananthakrishnan M; Shemona Gupta,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a major public health challenge in India. Malnutrition critically worsens clinical outcomes in patients with tuberculosis. The Nikshay Poshan Yojana (NPY), a national direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme in India, provides monthly nutritional support to TB patients. The NPY is a flagship program that plays a significant role in India's fight against TB, and its success depends on effective implementation. This scoping review synthesizes evidence on NPY implementation challenges and possible solutions and models their interconnections using a network approach. Leverage points that can enhance the program's performance are identified through network analysis and quantified via centrality metrics. Following a systematic search of relevant databases, 16 primary research studies evaluating the implementation of NPY were included in the synthesis. Qualitative findings on barriers and solutions were thematically synthesized and modeled as a network, with nodes representing the identified themes and edges indicating the co-occurrence of themes across studies. Degree and betweenness centrality measures identified key leverage points. Four main barrier categories were identified and thematically synthesized: administrative/procedural, financial/banking, patient-level, and healthcare system/provider. These contributed to significant payment delays (median: 43 days to 5.2 months). The network analysis revealed that ""lack of bank accounts"" was a highly central barrier (degree: 1.0000). Patients' health status also emerged as a critical bridging challenge (betweenness: 0.0604). The key solutions identified included simplifying banking and NPY processes (degree: 0.9286) and implementing a more robust monitoring and evaluation system (betweenness: 0.0482). Interventions targeted at these key leverage points, focusing on improved banking access, streamlined processes, and a strengthened health system, could potentially improve program implementation.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
41204077,Histoplasmosis in India: clinical insights from a tertiary care hospital.,BMC infectious diseases,2025,Jinal Soni; Atul Gogia; Anivita Aggarwal,"Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus, is a significant cause of endemic mycosis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. While considered endemic to the Gangetic Plains in India, reports from nonendemic regions have been increasing. This study aims to enhance the understanding and diagnosis of histoplasmosis by describing cases from a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. A retrospective study involving adult patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis was conducted at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India, from 1st July 2019 to 31st March 2024. Clinical data were extracted from the hospital’s electronic medical records and analysed. Eleven patients with a mean age of 48.4 years were identified. Of the patients, 10 (90.9%) were male. Except for one patient, all had identifiable risk factors such as immunosuppressive therapy, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), or diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (90.9%) and weight loss (72.7%). Hematological abnormalities such as anemia and leukopenia (36.3%) and radiological findings of splenomegaly (72.7%) and hepatomegaly (63.6%) were most common. Complications such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurred in 27.2% of patients, with a mortality rate of 18.18%. Our study highlights that, in India, histoplasmosis is frequently detected in its advanced disseminated form, particularly among immunocompromised patients, rather than at an early acute pulmonary stage. This delay is compounded by its clinoco-radiological resemblance to infections like tuberculosis and the limited availability of rapid diagnostic tools, often requiring invasive procedures. An enhanced understanding of histoplasmosis could help mitigate misdiagnosis and lead to better treatment outcomes. These findings call for increased clinical awareness amongst clinicians and early screening in at-risk groups, supported by expanded research to strengthen epidemiological data and establish clear diagnostic guidelines.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

The condition is a well-known mimicker of malignancy, both clinically and radiographically. Diagnostic dilemmas arise frequently in such cases, which delay the treatment. In the present study, we studied the cytomorphological features in cases of granulomatous mastitis diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to attribute the clinical and radiological findings to each case. A total of 13 cases with cytological diagnoses of granulomatous mastitis were reviewed and studied. Fine needle aspiration was performed on these patients, and smears were examined. In this study, the cytomorphological features were studied in depth and correlated with clinical and radiological findings. Ziehl-Neelsen stain and/or Truenat were performed in all 13 cases. Clinical examination revealed a lump in the breast in all the patients and a lump with pus discharge in two patients. Ultrasonographic examination suggested an inflammatory pathology in most of the cases. The smear examination showed diverse cytomorphological features, ranging from epithelioid cell granuloma to a vague collection of histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, neutrophils, plasma cells, and a few lymphocytes. In four cases, there was prominent emperipolesis of neutrophils. Additionally, granulomatous mastitis was diagnosed in accessory axillary breasts in one of the cases. Based on cytomorphological features and after excluding commonly encountered granulomatous infective pathology, a diagnosis of granulomatous mastitis was made. In addition, the cytological diagnosis rests on finding histiocytes with neutrophils, giant cells, and epithelioid cell granulomas with or without necrosis and excluding other common differential diagnoses like tuberculosis, fungal infection, and Rosai-Dorfman disease. It is important to keep a possibility of granulomatous mastitis in women presenting with painful nodular breast lumps. Aggressive management of other specific etiological causes of granulomatous mastitis can be avoided with an accurate cytological diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Such delays can perpetuate transmission within the community and disrupt ongoing efforts to eliminate TB. The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled proportion of pulmonary TB (P-TB) cases experiencing delays in seeking care across high-burden countries worldwide. Data extraction was conducted using three databases: PubMed, Scopus and DOAJ. This study was conducted as an extension of a scoping review, with the meta-analysis specifically aimed at estimating the pooled proportion of P-TB cases experiencing delays through quantitative data. The pooled proportion was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model, taking potential heterogeneity into account. Thirty-two full-text articles, selected from 831 articles, were included in the meta-analysis, representing China, India, Myanmar, South Africa and Nigeria. The total sample used across all the studies was 184,242 with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 5758 (17,236) and (median - 491, interquartile range - 271-1563). The highest total sample was from China (n = 176,642), and the lowest total sample was from Nigeria (n = 160). The pooled proportion of P-TB cases experiencing delays in China, India, Myanmar, South Africa and Nigeria was 50% (95% CI: 41-59), 50% (95% CI: 36-63), 38% (95% CI: 3-82), 47% (95% CI: 37-56) and 42% (95% CI: 34-50), respectively. The overall global proportion was 48% (95% CI: 41-55), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 99.85%) observed among the studies.

We developed a comprehensive care model (CCp-K) focusing on triaging persons with tuberculosis for severe illness, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol and nicotine dependence at diagnosis, and ensuring inpatient care and follow-up. In the pre-implementation phase, we explored the barriers, facilitators, and perceived suggestions in the design and implementation of CCp-K from various interest holders for sustainable implementation. We conducted an interest holder mapping and using the Power-Interest matrix of Mendelow, we purposively selected key interest holders at the district and state level. In-depth interviews were conducted using an interview guide by trained interviewers until data saturation was achieved. The audio recordings were transcribed, translated, and analysed using a framework-guided thematic analysis approach. Twelve interest holders participated in the interview, which included nine men and three women. The interviews lasted for a mean duration of 74 min (SD = 22). A total of 33 codes were generated and categorized under five themes: (i) perception on TB deaths (ii) relevance of CCp-K differentiated TB care model, (iii) perceived feasibility and enablers of implementing CCp-K, (iv) perceived barriers, and (v) perceived suggestions for the model and its delivery. The interest holders perceived that while delayed diagnosis contributes to TB mortality, the CCp-K model can bridge critical gaps in post-diagnosis care, particularly through early triaging and comorbidity management to reduce TB deaths. The robust healthcare infrastructure of Kerala, local governments and community involvement, and cross-adaptation opportunities from previous successful models were perceived as facilitators. The lack of nodal treatment centres, stigma among healthcare workers, social vulnerability, and competing priorities were perceived as major barriers. The interest holders perceived the CCp-K model to be relevant and feasible. However, Kerala should overcome the barriers of inadequate inpatient referral centers by establishing designated TB care facilities, leveraging existing collaboration with private partnerships, and strengthening the social support system.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
41123477,Updates in the clinical management of tuberculous meningitis.,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2025,Ravindra Kumar Garg,"Tuberculous meningitis is frequently associated with significant mortality and persistent neurological sequelae. Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms and the low sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. Standard pulmonary tuberculosis regimens are suboptimal for central nervous system involvement due to poor drug penetration and prolonged treatment. Emerging resistance, particularly to rifampicin and isoniazid, further complicates the management. This review synthesizes recent data particularly on diagnostic tools, drug treatment, host-directed treatments, and supportive care in tuberculous meningitis. We summarize updated WHO recommendations and explore the pharmacokinetics and CSF penetration of antituberculosis drugs. Emphasis is placed on high-dose rifampicin, linezolid, and novel oxazolidinones such as sutezolid and delpazolid. Special populations, including children, pregnant women, those with human immunodeficiency virus, and drug-resistant disease are reviewed separately. The latest information of a variety of host-directed therapies is discussed. The utility of artificial intelligence for diagnosis and prognostication is also discussed. Despite advances, tuberculous meningitis remains a clinical challenge. Early diagnosis, optimized dosing, and host-directed therapy are key priorities. Individualized regimens based on pharmacokinetics, drug resistance, and host factors are urgently needed.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of quality improvement interventions in reducing treatment delays using plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Methods The study implemented three interventions targeting different operational barriers: decentralising treatment initiation by routing diagnostic results to local TB units, enabling treatment initiation during holidays through accredited social health activists (ASHAs), and enhancing communication between molecular testing laboratories and peripheral units via multimedia groups. Data on delays (≥3 days) were collected from the Nikshay portal and analysed pre- and post-intervention. Results The interventions significantly reduced treatment delays, with the proportion of delayed cases dropping from 31 to 15 per cent after the first intervention. While the second intervention sustained a delay rate of 16 per cent, the third intervention further improved timeliness in rural hospitals, highlighting the critical role of efficient communication systems. However, resistance from healthcare providers in district hospitals limited the overall impact of the interventions. Operational challenges such as overburdened molecular laboratories and delays in updating results on the Nikshay portal were also identified. Interpretation & conclusions Quality improvement strategies, including decentralisation, holiday coverage, and enhanced communication, effectively reduced ATT initiation delays, particularly in rural settings. Addressing systemic inefficiencies and engaging stakeholders are critical for sustained improvements.

This delays the therapeutic decision and increases the work load on the TB laboratories. This study evaluated the utility of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) viability staining against culture as a modality to assess treatment response in patients receiving anti tubercular treatment. In a cross-sectional study conducted for 2 years at a tertiary care hospital, around 110 follow-up sputum samples from patients with initial smear positivity were collected. After being processed for light-emitting diode fluorescence (FL) microscopy and liquid culture by MGIT 960, the samples were subjected to FDA viability staining as an additional step. FDA staining and FL microscopy results were compared to culture to determine its diagnostic accuracy in predicting bacterial viability. The positivity rates for FL microscopy, FDA microscopy, and culture were 17%, 10%, and 8.18%, respectively. Culture results correlated with FL microscopy in 83.6% of cases and with FDA staining in 94.5%. FDA staining outperformed FL microscopy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and NPV, with values of 77.7%, 96.04%, 63.6%, and 97.9%, respectively. Among FL microscopy positive samples, FDA staining demonstrated 100% sensitivity and NPV, but poor specificity and PPV (57.14% and 45.45%, respectively) owing to false positive results in some cases. FDA viability staining proved to be a better predictor of bacteriological clearance during follow-up examinations of patients on antitubercular therapy and may be explored in future research.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This situation is exacerbated by delayed diagnosis, inadequate administration of effective TB medications, prolonged duration of treatment, shortage of toxin-free TB drugs, and frequent increases in resistance to most TB drugs. In an urge to find potential drug candidates for the treatment of fatal infectious TB disease, we targeted the folate biosynthetic pathway that involves the ubiquitous enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate with the generation of tetrahydrofolate (THF). Blocking the enzymatic activity of DHFR exhausts the cellular pool of THF, which results in cessation of DNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells and ultimately cell death. Herein, a total of 1026 drug-like molecules with antibacterial activities were tested using several <i>in silico</i> tools for determining drug-likeness features, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, binding affinity, and conformation analysis using Autodock Vina and Schrodinger Suite. This exhaustive investigation identified CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL1770248 as potential drug candidates for the inhibition of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> DHFR protein. Root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, hydrogen bond, and MMGBSA evaluation by 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) confirmed their molecular stability with the target protein. All of these drug-like compounds outperformed the control drugs trimethoprim and methotrexate in molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation tests. Therefore, our study suggests these <i>M. tuberculosis</i> DHFR inhibitors as promising drug candidates.

Acute or subacute painful cervical lymphadenopathy is the most common clinical presentation. The characteristic morphology in histopathologic examination of the lymph node specimen is diagnostic of KFD. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), often employed as the initial diagnostic method, gives inconclusive results due to inadequate specimens. Our patient was a 36-year-old woman who presented with cervical lymphadenopathy for six weeks. Despite an inconclusive FNAC result, she was treated with empirical antituberculosis therapy (ATT). Later, she was diagnosed with KFD in our facility on excisional lung biopsy in view of non-improvement with ATT. Ambiguous cytological findings may usually lead to the initiation of empirical ATT since tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of cervical lymphadenitis, particularly in TB-endemic areas.

In this study, we designed a<i>Gene-pimB</i>-based biosensor for the determination of TB and tested it using an electrochemical technique. The<i>Gene-pimB</i>has been reported to be upregulated in mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (manLAM) in multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Due to its link with drug resistance,<i>Gene-pimB</i>holds promise as a biomarker for identifying MDR-TB strains. In this work, the biosensor is fabricated using graphite-zinc oxide nanofibers (GPH-ZnO NFs), which are generated using electrospinning and deposited on glassy carbon electrodes. The GPH-ZnO functionalized electrode were further functionalized with MSA/EDC/NHS protocol to provide efficient immobilization which enable the effective binding of pimB-sequences to the nanofibers on the electrodes. In addition, the<i>Gene-pimB</i>hybridization on biosensors immobilized with<i>Gene-pimB</i>probe sequences was quantified using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The experimental tests revealed that the limit of detection (LoD) for CV is 0.1482 pM ml<sup>-1</sup>, for DPV it is 0.196 pM ml<sup>-1</sup>, and for EIS it is 0.302 pM ml<sup>-1</sup>. Our findings suggest that<i>Gene-pimB</i>may prove to be a useful technique in the creation of novel tests for TB prognosis. The efficacy of the developed biosensor was confirmed by a hybridization sensing assay including targeted short oligonucleotide sequences (probe) and<i>Gene-pimB</i>(target) isolated from the urine sample.

Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial SETTING: Three tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in southeast India. Newborn babies weighing <2000 g. 7067 were assessed for eligibility and 5420 were randomised (2714 BCG-OPV, 2706 control). Newborns were randomised 1:1 to receive 0.1 mL of BCG Danish intradermally plus OPV, either within 48 hours of admission to the NICU (early vaccination group) or delayed until at least the time of discharge (control group). Stratification was by NICU, sex, and birth weight (<1000 g, 1000-1499 g, 1500-1999 g). The primary outcome was all cause neonatal mortality. The main secondary outcome, included a third of the way through the trial, was neonatal mortality due to infection. Of the 5420 newborn babies randomised at a median age of 0.9 days and with a median birth weight of 1560 g, nine were lost to follow-up. Deaths occurred in 238 (8.8%) of 2714 newborn babies in the early vaccination group and 273 (10.1%) of 2706 in the control group. In intention-to-treat Cox survival analysis stratified by NICU and adjusted for postnatal age, birth weight, sex, and gestational age, neonatal mortality per person year was 1.29 in the early vaccination group and 1.50 in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.98; P=0.03). The number needed to treat to prevent one death was 21 (95% CI 10 to 245). Infection related neonatal mortality per person year was 0.40 in the early vaccination group and 0.73 in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70). No deaths from tuberculosis occurred, and no serious adverse effects were associated with vaccination. In newborn babies weighing <2000 g in intensive care, BCG-OPV administered at a median age of 0.9 days reduced all cause neonatal mortality owing to a decrease in deaths due to infections other than tuberculosis (a non-specific or off-target effect). A substantial reduction in neonatal mortality could be achieved if a skilled administrator vaccinated a high proportion of newborn babies in high mortality settings on the day of, or soon after, birth.

We aimed to prospectively evaluate the clinical features and diagnostic workup of children with suspected abdominal TB, with a focus on early initiation of medical and surgical treatment and monitoring of therapeutic outcomes. Materials and methods A time-bound prospective observational study of all patients ≤ 17 years requiring admission with symptoms suggestive of abdominal TB from February 2020 to May 2023 was conducted. All necessary routine blood tests and imaging were done, and endoscopies and surgeries as needed by the patient were carried out. The data of the patients who were diagnosed as abdominal TB - probable or definitive - were analyzed. Results Forty-seven patients were recruited with a suspected diagnosis of abdominal TB. Thirty-four patients (24 females and 10 males) were diagnosed as abdominal TB - definite in 18/34 patients (52.94%) and probable in 16/34 patients (47.06%). The mean age was 12.20 ± 3.82 years (4-17 years). Median duration of the symptoms was three months (IQR = 1-5 months). The commonest symptoms were abdominal pain (94.11%), fever (73.52%), and loss of appetite and weight (70.58%). Twelve patients (35.29%) gave a positive history of contact with TB. There were 13/34 (38.23%) patients who had concomitant pulmonary and abdominal TB, and 21/34 (61.76%) patients who had only abdominal TB. Mantoux tuberculin skin test was performed in 20 patients, of which 9/20 (45%) were positive. A Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) was performed in 30/34 patients (88.23%) from fluid or tissue samples, of which 11 patients (35.48%) showed CBNAAT positivity. Fifteen patients (44.11%) underwent surgery, 12 for intestinal perforation and three for intestinal obstruction. Out of the 18 definite cases of abdominal TB, 11/18 (61.111%) were CBNAAT positive, and 10/18 (55.55%) had histopathology suggestive of TB. The 16 probable cases of abdominal TB had a strong history and imaging suggestive of TB abdomen. A total of seven patients who underwent surgery for intestinal perforation expired. One patient developed a relapse, and four patients developed drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Conclusion Abdominal TB remains a common cause of acute abdomen in the pediatric population, often presenting with non-specific features and lacking a definitive diagnostic modality. Early detection through recognition of common clinical features, guided imaging, and timely sampling for confirmation is vital for initiating antitubercular therapy (ATT) and improving outcomes in abdominal TB.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Timely detection and proper treatment of TB are the key elements of an effective TB control program. Our aim in this study is to determine the diagnostic delay and the factors associated with delay, to estimate the out of pocket expenditure, and the treatment outcome in Extrapulmonary TB Patients. A mixed method study was carried out in Five TB Units of Bangalore Urban District on the newly diagnosed Extrapulmonary TB Patients of the last quarter of 2021. Data from registers and telephonic interviews were used to collect information for the quantitative data and the qualitative assessment was done through In-depth interviews. Out of 174 patients, 44.2% had a diagnostic delay of more than 1 month. The average expenditure among the subjects for diagnosis and treatment was estimated to be ₹ 56,681. 63% of the patients incurred an expenditure of above ₹ 10,000 before diagnosis and 18.9% had incurred an expenditure above ₹ 10,000 during treatment. 16.7% were lost to follow up, 0.6% were declared cured and 82.2% as treatment completed. In-depth interviews of 30 randomly selected patients with diagnostic delay was done to explore the reasons for delay, which were manually coded to generate the following codes-lack of awareness of symptoms and delayed referral, neglected symptoms and self medication, atypical presentation, misdiagnosis, wrong choice of diagnostic procedure, co-morbidities with overlapping symptoms, incidental finding, ignorance about Government facilities and free TB treatment, and absent or mild symptoms/slow progression of symptoms. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of EPTB to health care workers and public awareness about EPTB and provisions of Government facilities needs further emphasis.

This study aims to identify gaps and barriers in adhering to the national guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of EPTB. We included 433 patients having EPTB and followed up at predefined intervals of 2 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Questionnaire-based interviews of the treating physician and the patients in different departments were conducted. For confirmatory diagnosis, heavy dependence on clinical-radiological diagnosis without microbiological support was observed, which is a deviation from National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) guidelines and raises concerns about the potential for misdiagnosis and overtreatment. Apart from patient delays, long health system delays in EPTB were observed. The median patient delay, health system delay, and total treatment delay times were 4.2, 4, and 10.1 weeks, respectively.

In our country, it is compounded by difficulty in differentiating it from tuberculosis, in certain situations. Hence, we decided to specifically estimate the economic burden that patients with IBD must bear until definitive treatment is initiated. This prospective observational study included all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed IBD aged 18 years or older from October 2021 to December 2024. Details regarding symptom onset, investigations and treatments were collected using a structured questionnaire. Details regarding direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs were collected. Ninety-seven patients, mean age 38.7 ± 13.5 years, median symptom duration 15 (7-38.5) months, were included in this study.

Conventional diagnostic methods, such as smear microscopy, lack sensitivity and timeliness. This study evaluates the prognostic value of time to positivity (TTP) from liquid culture and cycle threshold (CT) values from GeneXpert <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>/rifampicin (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) in predicting treatment outcomes. This study aimed to assess the utility of baseline mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) TTP and GeneXpert CTvalues as early biomarkers for prognosis and the risk of MDR-TB development in smear-positive relapse and default PTB patients. This cross-sectional study with a prospective arm enrolled 72 adult PTB patients (relapse, default, or treatment failure). Sputum samples underwent smear microscopy, MGIT liquid culture, and GeneXpert testing. Baseline and three-month follow-up results were compared. TTP and CT values were correlated with microbiological outcomes. MGIT culture was positive in 52.8% (38/72) of patients (mean TTP: 26.5 days). In comparison, GeneXpert detected <i>M. tuberculosis</i> in 70.8% (51/72) (mean CT: 24.4). At follow-up, 7.8% (3/38) remained culture-positive (mean TTP: 29.7 days); one isolate was MDR. Patients with follow-up culture positivity had significantly lower baseline TTP (19.7 ± 3.4 vs. 25.8 ± 3.8 days). CT values trended lower among poor responders but did not reach statistical significance. Logistic regression suggested that a TTP threshold of ≤20.89 days might predict poor outcomes (model accuracy: 70%). Baseline MGIT TTP demonstrates significant prognostic potential in identifying patients with PTB at risk of treatment failure or MDR development. In contrast, GeneXpert CT values, while useful diagnostically, were less predictive of outcomes.

40628559,Imaging in Pott's spine: A review of typical and atypical imaging features and diagnostic challenges.,Current problems in diagnostic radiology,2025,Dr Rashmi Dixit; Dr Sonali Garg; Dr Gaurav Shanker Pradhan,"Pott's spine is associated with high morbidity, long-term disabling sequelae and even mortality. The classical paradiscal form, where there is destruction of end plates of adjacent 2-3 vertebral bodies along with intervening disc involvement and associated paravertebral abscess is well recognized. However, due to its varied clinical and radiological presentations, it remains a diagnostic challenge often resulting in delay in diagnosis. This is especially true of countries where tuberculosis has been almost eliminated but now are witnessing increase in incidence both due to immigration and HIV infection. Overlooking tuberculosis as a differential diagnostic consideration is very likely when the radiological presentation is not classical and consequent delay in diagnosis may have devastating consequences for the patient. In this review, we aim to describe various typical and atypical imaging findings of Pott's spine with special emphasis on atypical presentations including single vertebral body involvement, isolated posterior element involvement, intraspinal epidural abscess without vertebral involvement and skip lesions along with differential diagnostic considerations like metastases, fractures and spinal infections. The major focus is on magnetic resonance imaging findings which is the imaging modality of choice in patients presenting with neurological symptoms referable to the spine. Radiographic and Computed tomography findings are also discussed in brief. We also describe treatment and post treatment imaging in brief. Radiologists need to be aware of these atypical presentations as they may be the first to raise the possibility of tuberculosis which can avoid disabling long term sequalae.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

The exploration of new biomarkers is urgently required for TB diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the serum levels of Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an important diagnostic parameter in TB; lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a key constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall; and the expression of circulating microRNA-29a (miR-29a) in serum. MiR-29a contributes to increased susceptibility to TB by downregulating interferon-γ expression in T cells through post-transcriptional regulation, thereby exerting an immunosuppressive effect. The study was conducted on pulmonary TB (PTB), extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB), and control groups. Serum from the three groups was isolated, and IL-2 and LAM levels were measured by ELISA. Additionally, q-RT-PCR was conducted to analyse the expression of microRNA-29a in the serum of some TB patients. LAM and IL-2 were significantly upregulated in serum samples from both the PTB and EPTB groups compared to the control group. Additionally, the expression of miR-29a was significantly elevated in the EPTB group. This study suggests that LAM and IL-2 may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for both PTB and EPTB, while miR-29a may be a promising marker specifically for EPTB. However, further evaluation with larger cohort samples is required to validate the clinical utility of LAM, IL-2, and miR-29a as diagnostic TB markers.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

TB has even surpassed AIDS prior the COVID 19 pandemic. Every year the number of affected persons is increasing exponentially. In 2023 8.2 million new cases of TB were reported. There are various factors responsible for such infectivity rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) including emergence of rapid resistant strains, treatment failure and lack of proper diagnosis. In order to combat the infection, early and effective treatment of the infection is very crucial. This calls for the existence of effective and point of care (POC) diagnostic tool for successful management of the disease. The conventional diagnostics includes staining, microscopy, tuberculin skin test and chest X ray. However, they have various limitations which increases the public threat. These tools lack the ease of transportation, less sensitive, time consuming and lack accuracy. To eliminate such limitations and bridge the gap associated with the proper diagnosis of disease, various biochemical, molecular, immunological diagnostic tools have come up in rescue of the infection. These modern tools are potent enough in characterizing Mtb, detect mutations correlated with the existing medications and ensure effective management. In this article we are focusing on modern diagnostic tools such as T-SPOT, artificial intelligence, electronic nose, RT PCR, TB LAM, CRISPR, biosensor-based detection techniques including the conventional techniques for detection of Mtb in clinical setup in resource limited healthcare facilities for comprehensive diagnosis of tuberculosis.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This study aims to develop an injectable system for chronic tuberculosis treatment, focusing on an in-situ gel formulation created using Poloxamer 407, Carbopol 940, and Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC). The experiments involved a combination of two FDA-approved first-line anti-TB molecules, namely Rifampicin (RIF) and Isoniazid (INZ), by loading in the in-situ gel (IGS) formulations prepared by cold process. The gelling polymers were varied at three levels of concentration and optimized through the molecular docking method, wherein the blend of polymers with drugs showed the docking score of - 3.085. The physicochemical properties and analytical characterization, including gelation temperature, drug content, FT-IR, SEM, TG-DSC, in-vitro drug release, ex-vivo permeation, and cytotoxicity, were performed. According to the study results, the optimized gelation temperature was 26 °C, the viscosity of the sol and gel was 238 cP and 1700 cP, respectively, with the maximum drug content (RIF 100 ± 2.17% and INZ 97 ± 1.31%). The FTIR analysis confirmed the stability of drugs, the morphological study using SEM showed the formation of a network structure, and thermal analysis by TG-DSC confirmed the solid-state transition of drugs. The in-vitro drug release studies in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 showed sustained release of Rifampicin and Isoniazid for up to 10 days and 6 days, respectively. The selected formulation exhibited non-toxic effects in the L929 cell line. Based on the results, in-situ gel administration could be recommended for intramuscular administration for sustained release of the drugs, which is expected to reduce the dosing frequency and improve patient compliance for chronic tuberculosis therapy.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Early detection through systematic screening and diagnostic tools is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of the World Health Organization (WHO) four-symptom screen (fever, cough, weight loss, and night sweats), using Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California) as the gold standard for early detection of pulmonary TB in HIV-positive patients. A total of 249 HIV-positive patients attending a tertiary care centre in Western India were screened using the WHO four-symptom tool. All patients, regardless of symptoms, underwent testing with Xpert MTB/RIF. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for the symptom screen and individual symptoms. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine significance (P < 0.05). The WHO four-symptom screen identified 40.2% of participants (n = 100) as screen-positive. Xpert MTB/RIF confirmed pulmonary TB in 5.6% (n = 14) of the total population. The combined sensitivity and specificity of the WHO symptom screen were 85.7% and 62.6%, respectively, with a high negative predictive value of 98.7%. Fever and cough were the most significant predictors (P < 0.05) in multivariate analysis.

The bacterium is capable of evading the host's immune system, leading to the development of acute, subacute, or chronic invasive infections or potentially entering a latent state that may persist for an extended period. The true burden of melioidosis is vastly underestimated. Hot and humid climates with extreme weather conditions and rainy seasons are linked to increased melioidosis cases. Rice fields, building construction workers working on the muddy soil, and barefoot walkers in the endemic areas acquire infection <i>via</i> inadvertent inhalation or inoculation. Over 80% of patients diagnosed with melioidosis exhibit associated comorbid conditions predisposing them to infections. The disease mostly mimics tuberculosis of any organ. The blood or abscess fluid culture continues to serve as the cornerstone of diagnosis. Intravenous therapy for 4 weeks (from 2 to 8 weeks) or until culture conversion is essential for individuals presenting with concurrent bacteremia and bilateral or unilateral multi-lobar pneumonia. The prolonged oral eradication therapy is also essential after intravenous therapy to prevent relapse.

Despite its prevalence, renal TB often presents diagnostic challenges due to nonspecific clinical symptoms, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Increased occurrences of extrapulmonary TB have been observed in recent decades, linked to a rise in organ transplants and the prevalence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The urogenital form of the disease may arise from either disseminated infection or primary genitourinary localization. Symptoms typically include pyuria, dysuria, fever, flank pain, and burning micturition, often revealing a mass related to hydronephrosis of the affected kidney. Clinicians in regions with high TB prevalence, such as India, should maintain a high index of suspicion for renal TB, especially in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections.

The Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic bDMARD register (2009 to August 2024) was screened to enrol children with JIA and at least 3 months follow-up whilst on bDMARDs. Participant characteristics and clinical responses were collected in a pre-designed proforma to evaluate the primary objective i.e., studying outcomes among children with JIA on bDMARDs. The secondary objective was to study factors associated with time-to-remission (TTR) and flare-after-stopping-bDMARDs. One-hundred-fifteen children (59.1% boys) with 168 patient-years of bDMARD use were enrolled for this single-centre study. Enthesitis-related arthritis was the commonest subtype of JIA (n = 44, 38.3%). The most commonly used bDMARD was adalimumab (n = 43, 37.3%). The median (IQR) delay to initiation of bDMARD from the perceived need was 2 (0-6) months, primarily due to financial impediments (n = 81, 70.4%). Fifteen (13%) children screened positive for tuberculosis infection. One hundred ten (95.6%) children achieved remission on bDMARD, after a median (IQR) of 7.5 (4-12) weeks. Macrophage activation syndrome at initiation was significantly associated (HR 3.6 (1.3-10.0), p = 0.03) with a longer time-to-remission. bDMARDs were stopped in n = 68/115 (59.1%) after a median (IQR) 15 (9.6-26.5) months, of whom n = 33/68 (48.5%) flared at 6 (3.5-12) months of follow-up.

The most striking adverse events were serious infections requiring hospitalisation (n = 13, 11.3%) and tuberculosis (n = 4, 3.5%). All children who developed tuberculosis were on TNFi (Adalimumab). Though children on bDMARDs showed comparable remission rates, we noted a higher frequency of serious infections and tuberculosis, compared to the experience described from high-income countries. These observations highlight the need for further surveillance of outcomes of bDMARD use among children with JIA in an LMIC setting.

40493553,Impact of multiple consultations and switching in treatment-seeking in tuberculosis: Mathematical modelling and optimal control.,PloS one,2025,Preeti Saini; Samit Bhattacharyya,"Treatment-seeking behaviour significantly contributes to the worldwide tuberculosis (TB) burden, especially in Southeast Asia and African regions. At the onset of symptoms like coughing, fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite, individuals visit various clinics or alternative medicine centres, often switching multiple times before actually reaching a TB DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy Short Courses) centre. This, however, introduces a long delay in proper diagnosis and treatment of TB cases, which increases community transmission and the overall TB burden. By synthesizing data from various empirical studies, we develop an intricate mathematical model of such multiple consultations and aim to quantify the impact of such behavioural interactions on disease burden. Our SIR-based TB transmission framework quantifies the rise in active TB cases due to delays from multiple consultations before diagnosis and treatment at DOTS centres. We found that up to 2-3 consultations before diagnosis can substantially lower the overall TB burden. Using optimal control modelling, we propose targeted interventions - including enhanced TB awareness, early detection, and improved healthcare infrastructure. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and public health organizations to develop effective strategies for TB control in high-prevalent regions.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
40491731,Understanding antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity: Risk factors and effective management strategies in the pediatric population.,World journal of clinical pediatrics,2025,Pooja Semwal; Manjit Kaur Saini; Moinak Sen Sarma,"Antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDIH) is a significant concern while managing pediatric tuberculosis. There is limited data on pediatric ATDIH, and much of the management practices are extrapolated from adult experiences. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and management strategies for ATDIH in children. Pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and rifampicin are the most hepatotoxic first-line antituberculosis therapy (ATT). Though pyrazinamide has the highest potential for ATDIH, isoniazid is most frequently implicated. Hepatotoxicity typically manifests within the first 2-8 weeks of treatment, particularly during the intensive phase. Risk factors include younger age, female gender, malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and baseline liver dysfunction. Extra-pulmonary TB, particularly tuberculous meningitis, and concomitant hepatotoxic medications such as antiretro viral therapy or antiepileptic drugs further increase susceptibility. Genetic predisposition, including N-acetyltransferase 2 and cytochrome P4502E1 polymorphisms and specific HLA alleles also contribute to the increased risk. Clinically, ATDIH ranges from asymptomatic transaminase elevation to severe acute liver failure (ALF), necessitating prompt recognition and intervention. Diagnosis relies on the temporal association of liver injury with ATT initiation, supported by liver function tests, improvement upon ATT cessation, and recurrence upon reintroduction. Management involves discontinuing hepatotoxic drugs, initiating non-hepatotoxic regimens, and sequential reintroduction of ATT under close monitoring. For children with ALF, care in a tertiary center with liver transplantation expertise is essential. While pediatric ATDIH generally has favorable outcomes with timely intervention, delays can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Improved understanding of risk factors, vigilant monitoring protocols, and standardized pediatric management strategies are critical for optimizing outcomes in pediatric ATDIH.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Molecular diagnostic tools like Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, and Truenat MTB offer promising alternatives for the rapid and higher detection rates for pulmonary TB samples. However, the yield of these newly introduced molecular tests on extra-pulmonary samples requires country-specific evaluation and comparative analysis. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, and Truenat MTB assays in detecting EPTB on 211 clinical specimens collected at a tertiary care centre of central India. The assays' sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPP) were compared against a composite reference standard. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra exhibited the highest sensitivity (50%) for EPTB detection, outperforming the standard GeneXpert MTB/RIF (29.4%) and Truenat MTB (35.3%), with comparable specificity across all three assays. Among the specimen types, pus samples demonstrated the highest (value) diagnostic yield. These findings highlight the superior diagnostic capabilities of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, particularly in paucibacillary cases. Xpert Ultra demonstrates superior sensitivity for EPTB detection compared to Xpert MTB/RIF and Truenat MTB, making it a promising tool to enhance diagnostic accuracy in paucibacillary TB.

The CATALYST trial investigated the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in children with RR-TB. Children were enrolled in South Africa, India and the Philippines. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was undertaken while children were taking the standard non-dispersible 400 mg moxifloxacin tablet formulation and repeated after switching to the novel dispersible formulation. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed using population pharmacokinetic modelling. Simulations were performed to evaluate moxifloxacin exposures in children compared to consensus adult reference exposures using current World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended doses and more recent model-based doses.

This review examines the impact of pandemic-related disruptions, including the diversion of healthcare resources, reduced access to TB diagnostics and treatment, and declining BCG vaccination rates, on TB trends. The aim is to forecast the post-COVID-19 TB burden, identify risk factors that exacerbate transmission, and propose strategies to prevent a global resurgence. This narrative review incorporates epidemiological data, modeling research, and reports from the World Health Organization and national health systems. It examines TB trends before and after COVID-19, the outcomes of coinfection, and the pandemic's impact on immunology, socioeconomic factors, and health systems. The review also compares trends in India and South Africa-two countries facing significant challenges-to those observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 disruptions in healthcare led to an 18% decrease in TB notifications in 2020, resulting in delayed diagnoses, increased household transmission, and higher mortality. Immune dysregulation, including T-cell depletion and cytokine storms, contributed to a 12.3% mortality rate in COVID-19-TB coinfections. Models predict a 5%-15% rise in TB incidence and an additional 1.4 million deaths by 2025. Individuals with HIV, diabetes, and malnutrition were particularly vulnerable. Factors such as overcrowding, air pollution, and reduced Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) coverage in endemic regions have further heightened susceptibility to TB. COVID-19 has undone years of progress in TB control, highlighting the need for a unified health strategy. Early diagnosis, treatment of latent TB, and BCG catch-up initiatives are crucial.

Hence, an easily accessible diagnostic method, particularly for resource for resource-limited settings, is pertinent for the rapid identification of MTB-infected patients. In pursuit of developing such an assay, the present study offers a CLAP-TB (CRISPR-Cas coupled RT-LAMP Amplification Protocol for Tuberculosis) assay, which will allow us to diagnose TB rapidly and visually. Herein, the visual MTB detection consists of a method utilizing 232 different samples (sputum, urine, serum) from 82 patients for reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Additionally, the assay also utilizes the integration of a CRISPR-Cas12-based system using different guide RNAs of <i>IS6110</i> and an internal control <i>POP7</i> (human RNase P) genes along with visual detection via lateral flow readout-based dipsticks with the unaided eye (~134 min). Overall, the limit of detection for CLAP-TB assay was up to 1 ag of RNA, while the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 98.27% and 100%, respectively, on the pilot scale. Together, our CLAP-TB assay offers proof of concept for a rapid, sensitive, and specific method with the minimum technical expertise required for TB diagnosis in developing and resource-limited settings.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
40327607,Miliary Patterns on Computerized Tomography Imaging of Chest in Immunocompromised Patient: Unveiling Disseminated Histoplasmosis.,The American journal of case reports,2025,Sravani Kamatam; Anusha Akepati; Divya Shivakumar,"BACKGROUND Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare fungal infection caused by dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Immunocompetent patients are usually asymptomatic or have self-limiting disease; however, immunocompromised patients present as disseminated infection. Our case report includes an immunocompromised host with atypical presentation and imaging findings consistent with a miliary pattern that did not fit the classical clinical picture of disseminated histoplasmosis, causing a delay in the diagnosis. CASE REPORT We report a case of a patient who presented with shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, low-grade fevers, and weight loss, who received a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis, with an underlying immunocompromised state. Due to the ineffectiveness of initial management with empiric antibiotics, imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest was done, revealing miliary disease, and tuberculosis was first in the differential diagnosis. She had a positive histoplasma urine antigen, and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid tested positive for histoplasma antigen, confirming miliary histoplasmosis. Her CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed multiple lesions in the spleen and adrenal glands bilaterally, concerning for disseminated histoplasmosis, which was treated with amphotericin B, followed by itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare and challenging diagnosis; there should be a low suspicion for histoplasmosis in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, as mortality is high in such cases. Despite the inability to detect antibodies in immunocompromised patients, definitive diagnostic tests must be considered through culture and histopathology, the criterion standard tests, before excluding infectious causes. This case highlights the challenges faced in diagnosing and treating miliary histoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

A 40-year-old man who migrated from India 10 years prior with no medical history presented with a progressive dyspnea, night sweats, intermittent fevers, weight loss over a 3-month period, and a cough. An echocardiogram revealed cardiac tamponade and further biopsy revealed necrotizing granulomas with diffuse necrotic lymphadenopathy. Early anchoring bias led to an extensive tuberculosis (TB) workup which was initially negative. However, after broadening the differential, a co-infection of tularemia and latent extrapulmonary TB was identified as the etiology of cardiac tamponade. While tularemia in the setting of immunodepression has been identified as a cause for pericarditis, there is no current literature of a tularemia and TB co-infection causing cardiac tamponade.

This is mostly associated with the delayed diagnosis of Multidrug-resistant (MDR) or latent TB. Effective management of TB demands development of novel immunological strategies, such as peptide-based/subunit vaccines that can stimulate specific immune responses. In this context, we evaluated the immunogenic potential of two Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I/II-restricted peptides from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis): Rv2588c and Rv0148. The peptides were tested on T and monocyte populations from healthy donors and pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. Flow cytometry analysis revealed significant T cell activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from both groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated a strong IFN-γ response, confirming effective T cell activation. Additionally, these peptides induced increased nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages, indicating their role in activating the innate immune system. Overall, Rv2588c and Rv0148 peptides exhibited robust immunogenicity, stimulating both adaptive and innate immune responses in PBMCs from healthy and PTB individuals. These findings highlight their potential as promising TB vaccine candidates, paving the way for improved TB treatment and prevention strategies.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Delayed diagnosis and treatment due to absence of reliable point-of-care (POC) tools result in long-term pathological consequences and infertility. This pilot-scale study aims to identify the most noteworthy prognostic symptoms of genital infections that exhibit a significant correlation with reproductive tract disorders and infertility. We designed a detailed questionnaire and conducted a case-control, observational study with 100 female patients, categorized into infertile (n1 = 62) and healthy groups (n2 = 38) followed by statistical analysis. This study highlights an early onset of infertility (18-25 years). Approximately 27% of the infertile female patients are symptomatic for genital infections, and ~42% exhibit menstrual irregularities. Polycystic ovarian syndrome/disease (PCOS/PCOD, ~30%) appears to be the most predominant disorder, followed by endometrial disorders (~10%) and tubal damage (~8%) in infertile patients. A multivariate correlation analysis revealed a highly significant (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) and strong association (0.15 < Φ ≤ 1.0) between menstrual disorders, endometrial disorders, uterine/tubal blockage, and hormonal disruption with infection-associated symptoms, e.g. vaginitis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID), dyspareunia or infections like tuberculosis (TB) & urinary tract infection (UTI). Our study shows a significant contribution of genital infections to female infertility. Nevertheless, a substantial 73% of infertile patients are ineligible for confirmatory diagnosis due to the absence of classical infection symptoms. This underscores the pressing requirement for comprehensive screening strategies for timely management of reproductive health and fertility.

Induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are more accurate samples, but their use is not clearly recommended. This study evaluates the real-world feasibility and effectiveness of using a sequential collection of respiratory samples to diagnose PTB. PTB cases with sputum-scarce or smear-negative status were included. Sputum induction (SI) and BAL samples were collected. We used a composite reference standard (CRS) method as the reference. Of 220 cases screened, 156 were enrolled. Eighty cases underwent successful SI (group A), and 76 cases failed induction (group B). In group A, 53.75% of cases were positive for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) by cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT). Of the 112 cases that underwent flexible optic bronchoscopy (FOB), 85 were detected positive for PTB, of which eight were detected rifampicin-resistant by CBNAAT in BAL samples. The remaining cases were found to have an alternative diagnosis. Using the sequential approach, CBNAAT had a higher cumulative sensitivity (97.72%), specificity (100%), and diagnostic accuracy (DA) (98.08%) with a <i>p</i>-value < 0.001, as compared to either smear examination or culture. 27.56% of cases were able to avoid bronchoscopy using the sequential technique.

In adults, it varies from 10% to 40%. It has a variable spectrum of presentation; cough is the most common, but there can also be haemoptysis, dyspnoea, chest pain and wheezing. The non-specific symptoms and co-occurrence with parenchymal disease can delay the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy and computed tomography (CT) are the investigations of choice. Depending on the symptoms, chest imaging and bronchoscopic findings, the treatment can be conservative, medical or interventional. A 15-year-old male is presented; he was a known case of clinically and radiologically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis and was treated for 6 months with anti-tuberculous drugs. On presentation, there was a progressive cough, exertional dyspnoea, collapse consolidation of the left lung, ipsilateral mediastinal shift and partial stenosis of the left distal main bronchus on contrast-enhanced CT. Flexible fibre-optic bronchoscopy demonstrated atresia of the anterior segment and stenosis of the inferior lingular segment of the left bronchus with a normal right bronchus. Post-tuberculous bronchial stenosis should be focused on and managed early to prevent fibro-stenosis. Early treatment in a symptomatic patient is linked to a successful outcome.

The death rate from TB is influenced by numerous factors that include antibiotic drug resistance, noncompliance with chemotherapy by patients, concurrent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, delayed diagnosis, varying effectiveness of the Bacille-Calmette-Guerin vaccine, and other factors. Even with the recent advances in our knowledge of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the accessibility of advanced genomic tools such as proteomics and microarrays, alongside modern methodologies, the pursuit of next-generation inhibitors targeting distinct or multiple molecular pathways remains essential to combat the increasing antimicrobial resistance. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify and develop new drug targets against TB that have unique mechanisms. Novel therapeutic targets might encompass gene products associated with various aspects of mycobacterial biology, such as transcription, metabolism, cell wall formation, persistence, and pathogenesis. This review focuses on the present state of our knowledge and comprehension regarding various inhibitors targeting key metabolic pathways of M. tuberculosis. The discussion encompasses small molecule, synthetic, peptide, natural product and microbial inhibitors and navigates through promising candidates in different phases of clinical development. Additionally, we explore the crucial enzymes and targets involved in metabolic pathways, highlighting their inhibitors. The metabolic pathways explored include nucleotide synthesis, mycolic acid synthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and energy metabolism.

At treatment initiation, we recommend standard nutritional assessment with anthropometric measurements and haemoglobin estimation, in addition to macronutrient and micronutrient support alongside nutritional counselling. Weight should be monitored during treatment and lack of weight gain at the end of the intensive phase should prompt an investigation of causes, such as food insecurity, poor treatment adherence, malabsorption, uncontrolled diabetes, or drug resistance. At the end of treatment, we recommend reassessing anthropometric measures to assess nutritional recovery. People with tuberculosis who remain underweight should receive close follow-up to detect early relapse. We call for annual reporting of nutritional metrics by WHO, explicit inclusion of nutritional assessment and care in national strategic plans, domestic or international support of nutritional programmes for people with tuberculosis, increased support for operational research initiatives, and integration of nutritional care into the WHO Multisectoral Accountability Framework at national and regional levels.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Retropharyngeal space lesions can produce significant morbidity, given their proximity to the aero-digestive tract, skull base and its ability to extend into upper mediastinum. Difficulty in assessing the retropharyngeal space by direct inspection or physical examination may cause delay in diagnosis and early intervention thus knowledge about these lesions and their effective management is essential. This is a retrospective analysis of 10 cases evaluated at the ENT Department of Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute with a diagnosis of various retropharyngeal space lesions. Retropharyngeal abscesses (6 cases) were managed surgically by incision and drainage along with antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity, out of which one was of tubercular in origin which was managed with anti tubercular drugs(ATT). Cervical osteophytes (2 cases) were managed conservatively. Retropharyngeal Myxoma(1case) was managed with intra-oral excision.

As part of bone and joint tuberculosis (5-6% of all extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases), elbow tuberculosis is a rare manifestation-especially in the Western world-and is associated with nonspecific symptoms such as swelling, redness, and painful limitation of motion. This often leads to initial misdiagnoses, such as septic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. A 27-year-old male patient from Bangalore, South India presented with left elbow pain and restricted motion. The clinical and imaging findings led to the suspicion of olecranon bursitis. Intraoperatively, joint tuberculosis was suspected; therefore, multiple tissue samples were taken and a diagnostic routine according to guidelines was initiated. The tuberculosis-specific interferon gamma test was positive and thus confirmed the patient's previous contact with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since extrapulmonary tuberculosis is often caused by multidrug-resistant mycobacterial strains, tuberculostatic therapy was started after obtaining the resistogram. Under the initiated therapy, a reduction in synovial inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging and a rehabilitation of the mobility of the elbow were achieved over a period of more than 15 months. The basis for finding the diagnosis is a detailed, interdisciplinary diagnostic process, especially in patients with persisting unspecific symptoms, since joint tuberculosis is frequently the only site of manifestation. Despite the slow growth of mycobacteria, the microbiological findings, particularly the resistogram, should be awaited since extrapulmonary tuberculosis is often multidrug resistant.

However, its clinical and radiological features can resemble those of Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL). While Gene X-pert MTB/Rif Ultra and computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies are common diagnostic tools for TB, they may sometimes be inconclusive. In such cases, HL should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scans are useful in assessing whether the disease is metabolically active. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective treatment, especially when initial tests suggest an infectious cause. A 16-year-old male presented with lower back pain radiating to the lower limbs and difficulty walking. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed vertebral body destruction suggestive of spondylodiscitis. Despite anti-tubercular therapy, his condition worsened. Gene X-pert MTB/Rif Ultra and multiple CT-guided biopsies initially suggested a granulomatous lesion but did not confirm TB. Subsequent imaging revealed systemic nodular lesions, raising the suspicion of malignancy. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed HL with positivity for CD15 and CD30. The patient responded positively to chemotherapy and has been in remission for 1 year. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of distinguishing between spinal TB and HL. Initial tests such as Gene X-pert MTB/Rif Ultra and CT-guided biopsies can sometimes produce false negatives, leading to delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The use of PET-CT and detailed immune-histochemical analysis proved crucial in this case, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach when conventional treatments fail. This case contributes to the orthopedic literature by highlighting the need to consider HL in differential diagnoses and the role of advanced imaging and biopsies in ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

We assessed the pharmacokinetics of a child-friendly, dispersible 100 mg tablet moxifloxacin formulation (dispersed in water) compared to the standard 400 mg non-dispersible formulation (crushed and suspended in water) in children and evaluated current dosing recommendations. The CATALYST trial investigated the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in children with RR-TB. Children were enrolled in South Africa, India and the Philippines. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was undertaken while children were taking the standard non-dispersible 400 mg moxifloxacin tablet formulation and repeated after switching to the novel dispersible formulation. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed using population pharmacokinetic modelling. Simulations were performed to evaluate moxifloxacin exposures in children compared to consensus adult reference exposures using current World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended doses and more recent model-based doses. Thirty-six children were enrolled [median age 4.8 (range 0.4-15) years and weight 15.6 (range 6.9-42.1) kg]. A two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination and delayed absorption was developed. The bioavailability of dispersible versus standard formulations fulfilled standard bioequivalence criterion (ratio 1.05 with 90% confidence interval 0.95-1.15). Simulations showed WHO-recommended doses achieved exposures similar to those in adults in children >10 kg, while children <10 kg may require 33%-56% higher doses to reach adult reference exposures. Dosing recommendations for children can be the same for the dispersible paediatric and standard non-dispersible adult moxifloxacin formulation. The current WHO dosing recommendation risks underdosing moxifloxacin in children <10 kg. We propose optimized moxifloxacin doses for both formulations.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This phenomenon is reported in several viral and non-infectious diseases and is classified as a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response. The present cross-sectional study was conducted in the histopathology section of the Department of Pathology, MMIMSR, Mullana, from October 2022 to October 2023. A total of 100 cases presenting with granulomatous lesions were analyzed. Detailed clinical data, including age, sex, site of the lesion, and duration of disease, were recorded. Histopathological examination was performed using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain, with additional special stains like Ziehl-Neelsen and Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) applied where necessary. This investigation was conducted at the histology division of the Department of Pathology, MMIMSR, Mullana, between October 2022 and October 2023. The analysis included a total of 100 patients that had granulomatous lesions. Precise clinical information, such as age, gender, location of the lesion, and length of illness, was documented. The histological analysis was conducted using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stain, along with supplementary specific stains, such as Ziehl-Neelsen and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) when needed. Lesions of granulomatous nature were more common in individuals in their third and fourth decades of life, with a little higher occurrence in females (male: female ratio = 1:1.43). The primary location of infection was the gastrointestinal system, accounting for 16% of cases, followed by the urogenital tract at 15% and soft tissues at 13%. Granulomatous pathology-not otherwise specified (GP-NOS) was the most prevalent histological category, representing 52% of cases. It was followed by granulomatous pathology-tubercular (GP-TB) at 15%, granulomatous pathology-leprosy (GP-L) at 3%, and one case of granulomatous pathology-fungal (GP-F). The etiology of 25% of cases was attributed to tuberculosis, whereas in 3% of instances, it was diagnosed as leprosy. The main kind of neoplasms seen were epithelioid cell granulomas, with caseous necrosis being the most prevalent form of necrosis. About 10% of patients had fibrosis, and Langhans giant cells were often documented. Histopathology, with the use of certain stains, continues to be the most reliable method for identifying and classifying granulomatous lesions. Despite the broad use of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, infections, including tuberculosis (TB), remain the primary cause of granulomatous lesions in our community.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This study examines factors affecting the mortality of HIV patients and the effect of delay in diagnosis on survival. In this retrospective cohort study, data from the ART Center of Koppal District Hospital, India, from April 2007 to August 2023 were used. Of the 11,799 patients, 8,092 with complete data were included in the final analysis. Demographic and clinical variables including age, gender, HIV status, treatment, laboratory parameters, TB infection and survival were investigated. Delayed diagnosis was defined as CD4 ≤ 350. Statistical analyzes were performed with Cox regression and survival curves (Kaplan-Meier). Out of 8092 patients, 5897 (72.8%) had delayed diagnosis. The average survival time for patients with delay was 61.55 months and without delay was 84.09 months. Delay in diagnosis increases the risk of death with HR 3.01 (95% CI: 2.67-3.40) in univariate analysis and HR 1.70 (95% CI: 1.48-1.96) in multivariate analysis. TS/TG patients had a higher risk of death than women with a HR of 1.64 (95% CI: 1.52-1.78) and patients over 45 with a HR of 2.17 (95% CI: 1.94-2.43) compared to those under 30. AIDS stage patients had a higher risk of death with HR 2.54 (95% CI: 2.34-2.75) and TB patients with HR 1.43 (95% CI: 1.31-1.56). delay in diagnosis, age, disease stage and the presence of TB are important factors of mortality in patients with HIV. Early diagnosis and timely management of the disease can reduce the risk of death and increase the life expectancy of patients.

To address this, government of India introduced Nikshay Poshan Yojana in 2018 to provide nutritional support to patients with TB. However, the end-usage and barriers of the monetary benefit under this scheme have not been extensively studied. To address these gaps, our study aimed to estimate Nikshay Poshan Yojana coverage among patients with tuberculosis in the Ballabgarh tuberculosis unit, explore end-usage patterns, and identify facilitators and barriers for availing the monetary benefit. We conducted a mixed-methods study in Ballabgarh tuberculosis unit (TU) in Faridabad district of Haryana state, India. To assess the coverage, we randomly selected patients treated under the Ballabgarh TU between January 2019 and December 2021. We conducted telephonic interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire and collected data on the coverage and end usage of the Nikshay Poshan Yojana scheme. Descriptive analysis was conducted using R software. We conducted in-depth interviews with a senior treatment supervisor and a district tuberculosis officer and two focus group discussions with tuberculosis patients. Thematic analysis was used to identify the factors of end usage, facilitators, and barriers of the use of monetary benefits under the scheme. Among the 251 patients with TB enrolled in the study, 60.6% received at least one and 22.3% received all instalments. The median amount received was INR 2500 (USD 31.2), with 90.9% of the funds being spent on purchasing food items. Fruits and milk were the main food items purchased. Factors influencing the end usage included personal or family needs, awareness of the nutritional benefits in addressing the disease, advice from parents and Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) providers, and the need for diagnostic tests or medications. Facilitators for utilization included assistance in creating bank accounts, centralized monitoring, and the flexibility of receiving the monetary benefit through parents' or family members' accounts. The barriers for utilization of Nikshay Poshan Yojana were non-availability of bank account, dormant bank account, delay due to bank related issues or administrative procedures. The findings revealed a substantial partial coverage and poor full coverage of Nikshay Poshan Yojana. The monetary benefit received was primarily utilized for purchasing food items, indicating adherence to the intended purpose.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

We enrolled presumptive EPTB patients for a cohort study from 2018-2020 in Ujjain, India. Based on a structured questionnaire, the patients were interviewed for socio-demographic and clinical information, including previously visited health facilities (HF) for this illness. We analysed patients' TTD, healthcare access, and referral pathways. EPTB (54%) and non-TB (58%) patients visited dispensaries during their first visit to a formal HF. Patients visited multiple HFs, including dispensaries (54%) and regional hospitals (32%), during 1-4 visits but did not receive an appropriate diagnosis. Less than 2% of the patients accessed private HFs. Most of the adult EPTB (83%) and non-TB (76%) patients were self-referred to our study site, where they were diagnosed. Our statistical models highlighted low-middle income groups, longer distances and longer travel time to HFs, and potentially less-empowered occupations as housewives with a prolonged TTD. Patients with a longer wait, including travel time, had a shorter TTD.

Due to lack of awareness and the stigma associated with TB, Indian TB elimination efforts are facing challenges. Patients with less information are more likely to experience delays in diagnosis and proper care. A cross-sectional study was conducted in New Delhi across 26 operational National TB Elimination Program districts, involving 200 adult pulmonary TB patients receiving treatment from April to August 2020. A structured questionnaire guided the interviews, followed with bivariate analysis and descriptive statistics used for analysis. Predominantly, residents of semiurban regions accounted for the highest proportion (70.5%), followed by urban areas (20.5%), with rural areas/slums comprising a minority (9%). Notably, a significant majority (94.5%) reported residing in individually owned dwellings, with shared accommodations limited to a minority (5.5%). Sanitary facilities varied, with 77% possessing personal toilets, 18.5% utilizing private facilities, and only 4.5% relying on public toilets. Awareness levels about TB reflected moderate awareness among 56% of participants, good knowledge among 41%, and minimal awareness (poor knowledge) among only 3% of respondents. Age, sex, socioeconomic level, kind of lodgings, malnutrition, and personal cleanliness should all be taken into account for TB treatment adherence. A new set of frameworks should be developed to enhance the living circumstances of high-risk populations and patients who are living in crowded locations since sharing a room or a house in a populated region increases the risk of TB transmission.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

EP-TB mimics common infections which pose diagnostic dilemma, requires extensive diagnostics that culminate into therapeutic delay often resulting in irrational and empirical institution of antitubercular therapy (ATT) in challenging cases. This supplemented by poor treatment compliance resulted in emergence of Drug-resistant (DR) strains of EP-TB which further impedes the path to recovery. The aim of the present series is to study the rare and diverse presentations of EP-TB caused by drug-sensitive (DS) and DR mycobacterium that require a multi-modal diagnostic approach and appropriate treatment. This observational retrospective series incorporated six rare EP-TB cases, excluding those with solitary lung affection and underwent comprehensive diagnostic tests aimed at microbial isolation from affected tissues with subsequent drug resistance testing. They were treated by integrative approach, standard (first/second/third line) ATT while few required emergent surgical interventions. Patient outcomes were evaluated based on clinicoradiological improvement and microbiological clearance determined in follow-up. Out of six cases (four males and two females; age range: 14-62 years), pleural linings, kidneys, brain and its lining, skin, and axial skeleton were directly affected, while superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome was an indirect consequence of infection. Elective thoracic and urosurgical interventions supplemented medical management in two cases while urgent neurosurgical decompression improved outcomes in Pott's spine case that exhibited drug resistance. Notably of five DS EP-TB, one patient showed poor clinical response necessitating treatment escalation while nutritional rehabilitation was key in SMA syndrome.

The causes of these perforations include infections such as tuberculosis and enteric fever, as well as malignancy and trauma. Management options encompass ileostomy, resection with anastomosis, and primary closure. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical profile, etiology, management strategies, and complications associated with ileal perforation. Methodology A total of 70 patients with ileal perforation were included in the study. The proportions of various etiological factors, surgical interventions, and their associated complications were analyzed. The study aimed to determine whether ileostomy leads to fewer complications compared to primary repair. Results Ileal perforation is more prevalent in males than in females, with an incidence ratio of 2.68:1, predominantly affecting individuals in their 30s. Antituberculosis treatment does not consistently protect against perforation. Delays in presentation are linked to a higher likelihood of developing pyoperitoneum, increased chances of stoma creation (with a mean delay of 2.50 days in the closure group compared to 4.98 days in the ileostomy group), and greater mortality. Closure was performed in 18 patients (25.7%), while 52 patients (74.3%) underwent stoma creation. The duration of surgery was longer in the closure group (2.889 hours) than in the ileostomy group (2.635 hours) and also greater in the mortality group (three hours) compared to the non-mortality group (2.64 hours). The mean number of perforations was 1.59 ± 0.970, with 1.33 ± 0.840 in the closure group and 1.67 ± 1.004 in the ileostomy group. A higher number of perforations is associated with an increased likelihood of stoma creation. The most common cause of perforation was nonspecific, accounting for 40% of cases. The most frequently encountered complication was wound infection, occurring in 42.9% of patients. The mean duration of hospital stay was shorter in the ileostomy group (9.50 ± 5.500 days) than in the closure group (17.22 ± 19.219 days). Death occurred in 18.6% of cases, with higher rates observed in males (8:5), patients with delayed presentation, and elderly patients.

The clinical manifestations of abdominal TB frequently resemble those of various gastrointestinal disorders, potentially leading to delays in accurate diagnosis. <b>Materials and methods:</b> From January 2012 to December 2019, consecutive patients aged 12 years and older, diagnosed with gastrointestinal TB at a tertiary care center in North India, were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data, radiological imaging findings, gastrointestinal endoscopy results, and histopathological findings were meticulously recorded. Antitubercular treatment was administered, and gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed upon the completion of treatment. <b>Results:</b> During the study period, 234 patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis were enrolled, of which 151 (64.5%) were male and 83 (35.5%) were female. The most common presenting symptoms included weight loss (94.9%), abdominal pain (85.9%), fever (51.7%), and diarrhea (30.8%). The ileocecal region was the most frequently affected site (76.1%), followed by segmental colonic TB (17.1%). The most common finding on computed tomography (CT) of abdomen was thickening of the bowel wall with/without local or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The most common endoscopic lesions were ulcerations (82.0%) followed by nodularity (73.9%), deformed cecum and ileocecal valve (41.9%) and strictures (11.1%). Histopathological examination of endoscopic biopsy revealed, well-formed granulomas in 94 (40.2%), collection of epithelioid cells with Langhans giant cells in 66 (28.2%), and chronic nonspecific inflammatory changes in 74 (31.6%). All patients responded to the antitubercular treatment. Follow-up colonoscopy in 171 (73.1%) patients showed regression of lesions. <b>Conclusion:</b> Gastrointestinal tuberculosis (GiTb) presents with nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss, fever, and abdominal pain, with ileocecal region being most commonly involved. Gastrointestinal endoscopy shows ulceration, nodularity, and strictures as prominent findings. Histopathology and culture were helpful for making diagnosis in almost half of the patients with GiTb.

Coinfection with both these organisms is rarely documented in immunocompetent host. Due to overlapping symptoms, it can be easily missed and treatment delays are not uncommon. Here, we report a case of a 62-year-old male with a chronic history of intermittent fever and dry cough, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and persistent pancytopenia. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis with cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) positivity from a paratracheal lymph node biopsy. Simultaneously, a bone marrow biopsy revealed Histoplasmosis and the patient was started on dual treatment (Itraconazole and antitubercular drugs). After an initial response, the patient developed new space-occupying cerebral lesions. CSF histoplasma antigen was also positive. The reason for treatment failure was likely to be drug interaction (suboptimal levels of itraconazole due to rifampicin). The patient received liposomal amphotericin and subsequently put on a modified antitubercular treatment regimen to avoid interaction with itraconazole. At 2-month follow-up, the patient's condition significantly improved with a substantial resolution in CNS lesions. Histoplasmosis and tuberculosis have overlapping symptoms, diagnosing one does not preclude the possibility of other, even in non-HIV patients.

Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear microscopy, commonly used for TB diagnosis, has limitations in sensitivity, especially in cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (ETB). The GeneXpert <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF) assay, a molecular diagnostic tool, offers rapid and accurate detection of MTB and RIF resistance. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of GeneXpert MTB/RIF with ZN staining in detecting pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and ETB. Methods A prospective study was conducted over two years (April 2022 to April 2024) at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. A total of 319 clinical samples from patients with suspected PTB and ETB were analyzed. Samples underwent ZN staining and GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using mycobacterial culture as the gold standard. The chi-square test was employed to compare diagnostic accuracy, with a p-value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. Results Of the 319 samples, ZN staining was positive in 18.2% of cases, while GeneXpert was positive in 21.6%. GeneXpert demonstrated a perfect sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98.81%, compared to ZN staining's sensitivity of 84.85% and specificity of 99.21%. GeneXpert showed superior performance in detecting TB in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). Additionally, GeneXpert identified six cases of RIF resistance. Conclusion The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay outperforms ZN staining in diagnosing TB, offering higher sensitivity and comparable specificity. Its ability to detect RIF resistance adds significant clinical value.

This study explored the role of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in regulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, M. tb invasion into the central nervous system (CNS), and disease progression of Central Nervous System Tuberculosis (CNS-TB) in a Balb/c mouse model. The modulation of the SHH pathway using agonist Purmorphamine (PUR) and antagonist Cyclopamine (CYC) revealed that CYC treatment led to a rapid and extensive invasion of M. tb in the brain, with bacterial loads increasing by 99 % compared to the untreated-infected group. In contrast, PUR reduced M. tb loads by 50 % and delayed disease progression. Histopathological analysis showed that CYC exacerbated inflammation and immune cell infiltration, while PUR mitigated these responses. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CYC caused severe BBB breakdown and reactive gliosis, while PUR partially attenuated this response. Further analysis revealed that CYC upregulated Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion, a key contributor to BBB disruption. These findings highlight the critical role of the SHH pathway in maintaining BBB integrity and regulating the immunopathological response during CNS-TB, opening up future scope for drug discovery. This Cyclopamine-induced model of rapid M. tb invasion and chronic inflammation provides a new tool for studying CNS-TB pathogenesis and evaluating potential therapeutic interventions targeting the SHH signaling axis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Understanding how tuberculosis (TB) infection can spread to the brain is crucial, as this ""central nervous system TB"" (CNS-TB) is a serious and potentially life-threatening health complication. However, studying CNS-TB in humans is very difficult. Animal models are needed to better understand how TB gets into the brain and the resulting damage. This study in mice showed that blocking a signaling pathway called Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) allowed TB to rapidly spread to the brain, damaging the blood-brain barrier and causing severe inflammation. In contrast, activating the SHH pathway helped protect the brain from TB. These findings provide important insights that could lead to new ways to prevent or treat this dangerous form of TB.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Drug repositioning, or drug repurposing, involves identifying new therapeutic applications for existing drugs, utilising their established safety profiles and pharmacological data to swiftly provide effective treatments against resistant pathogens. Several drugs, including otilonium bromide, penfluridol, eltrombopag, ibuprofen, and ceritinib, have demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. These drugs can disrupt biofilms, damage bacterial membranes, and inhibit bacterial growth. The combination of repurposed drugs with conventional antibiotics can reduce the required dosage of individual drugs, mitigate side effects, and delay the development of resistance, making it a promising strategy against MDR bacteria such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Despite its promise, drug repurposing faces challenges such as potential off-target effects, toxicity, and regulatory and intellectual property issues, necessitating rigorous evaluations and strategic solutions. This article aims to explore the potential of drug repurposing as a strategy to combat antibiotic resistance, examining its benefits, challenges, and future prospects. We address the legal, economic, and practical challenges associated with repurposing existing drugs, highlight successful examples, and propose solutions to enhance the efficacy and viability of this approach in combating MDR bacterial infections.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This study included 58 patients. The clinicopathological profile of patients and the outcome of treatment with antitubercular therapy were noted. The majority of patients had level V (39.6%) involvement. Incidental diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was seen in 2 cases (3.4%). Fever was the commonest constitutional symptom observed in 27.5% of cases. FNAC was suggestive of tubercular abscess in 48.2% and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay detected Mycobacterial tuberculosis in all the cases with rifampicin resistance in only one case. 56 cases (96.5%) had complete resolution after completion of antitubercular therapy including patients with rifampicin resistance and patients with diabetes mellitus. In the remaining two cases, treatment was prolonged for a few months before the resolution of the disease was observed.

TB diagnosis, treatment, and success are complicated by the chronic nature of the disease as well as additional stressors including financial, psychological, and social hardships, adverse events associated with management, and poor compliance towards anti-tuberculosis medications. This is a longitudinal study conducted in the Tuberculosis Units (TUs) of rural field practice areas of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Medicine in a tertiary care hospital in Odisha. 168 diagnosed TB patients from the TUs were enrolled after registration in NTEP and were followed up every month for 6 months or treatment completion. TB patient's cost estimate tool was used to collect data regarding the cost incurred by the patients before and during the diagnosis as well as in the post-diagnosis or treatment period. Out-of-pocket expenditure was calculated as direct, indirect, and total cost in the pre and post-diagnostic phases of the disease. The median pre and post-diagnosis direct, indirect and total costs were ₹ 12,805, ₹ 16,960 and ₹ 31,192, respectively, with almost 62 % of participants spending more than 20 % of their annual income. In this study, 41 % of participants had to stop working for more than 60 days, and 53.1 % faced distress financing due to the disease. Through this study, we found that more than half of rural TB patients still visit private health facilities, and 20 % start anti-TB drugs by purchasing them from private pharmacies, which incur substantial out-of-pocket expenditure.

Learnings from prevalence surveys provide justification for active TB Case finding (ACF), role of Chest X-ray screening, justification of the elderly as a key vulnerable population and suggest re-think of the methods of sub-national certification for progress towards tuberculosis free status. Risk of infection studies suggest 14 million people acquiring new tuberculous infection each year in India suggesting a re-think on the targets for TB elimination. Justification is given for 'TB deaths averted' as a parameter for monitoring program impact, reviving risk of infection surveys using CyTB and higher emphasis on careful analysis of routine surveillance data for monitoring epidemiological trends rather than oft-repeated surveys. The modelling outputs suggest higher focus on reducing transmission of infection in urban and reducing treatment delay in rural areas and the need to scale up active case finding and TB preventive treatment in order to achieve End TB targets. Case finding studies justify upfront molecular diagnostics, need to confirm a single sputum result by another specimen or radiology during ACF and futility of X-ray based diagnosis during ACF. High rates of recurrence with intermittent treatment regimen providing evidence in favor of daily regimen, role of family centric approach to nutritional supplementation to prevent TB mortality and reduce TB incidence among household contacts are highlighted besides the need to address high proportion of families suffering catastrophic expenses during pre-treatment period.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This has motivated us to study clinicoepidemiological, histopathological profile and outcome post treatment of cutaneous tuberculosis patients of our region in detail. Total 78 patients were studied during the period of August 2018-2022, who were suspicious to have cutaneous tuberculosis clinically of which 54 were confirmed with histopathology. Patient related clinicoepidemiological data such as age, gender, past history of tuberculosis or contact history, chest-x ray, tuberculin test positivity was analysed in a retrospective manner. Among the 54 biopsy proven cases (33 women, 21 men) ranging from 6 to 76 years, 27 patients have been found to have Lupus Vulgaris followed by 15 cases of scrofuloderma. Acid fast bacilli were seen in 9 patients with majority in scrofuloderma. Histopathology revealed epithelioid cell granuloma without necrosis in 34 cases and caseation necrosis in 20 patients. 48 patients showed complete recovery with 6 months of Anti-Koch Treatment and some complications were observed in remaining. Limitation of this research was that long term follow up was not possible. Lack of familiarity might lead to overlooking of a standard presentation or misdiagnosis.

39240337,Therapeutic drug monitoring in tuberculosis.,European journal of clinical pharmacology,2024,M Sarkar; J Sarkar,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a standard clinical procedure that uses the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug in the body to determine the optimal dose. The pharmacokinetic variability of the drug(s) is a significant contributor to poor treatment outcomes, including the development of acquired drug resistance. TDM aids in dose optimization and improves outcomes while lessening drug toxicity. TDM is used to manage patients with tuberculosis (TB) who exhibit a slow response to therapy, despite good compliance and drug-susceptible organisms. Additional indications include patients at risk of malabsorption or delayed absorption of TB drugs and patients with drug-drug interaction and drug toxicity, which confirm compliance with therapy. TDM usually requires two blood samples: the 2 h and the 6 h post-dose. This narrative review will discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TB drugs, determinants of poor response to therapy, indications of TDM, methods of performing TDM, and its interpretations. This is a narrative review. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the CINAHL from inception to April 2024. We used the following search terms: tuberculosis, therapeutic drug monitoring, anti-TB drugs, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, limited sample strategies, diabetes and TB, HIV and TB, and multidrug-resistant TB.

The main challenge, given the magnitude of tobacco use and limited resources, is delivering cessation support at scale, low cost, and through a coordinated cross-system effort; one such example being brief advice interventions. However, highly credentialed staff to identify and counsel tobacco users are scarce. Task-shifting is an important opportunity for scaling these interventions. The LifeFirst SWASTH (Supporting Wellbeing among Adults by Stopping Tobacco Habit) program-adapted from the LifeFirst program (developed by the Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation, Mumbai, India)-is a tobacco cessation program focusing on lower-socioeconomic status patients in Mumbai receiving private health care. This parallel-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial investigates whether the LifeFirst SWASTH program increases tobacco cessation rates in low-resource, high-reach health care settings in Mumbai. This study will target tuberculosis-specific nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), dental clinics, and NGOs implementing general health programs serving lower-socioeconomic status patients. Intervention arm patients will receive a pamphlet explaining tobacco's harmful effects. Practitioners will be trained to deliver brief cessation advice, and interested patients will be referred to a Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation counselor for free telephone counseling for 6 months. Control arm patients will receive the same pamphlet but not brief advice or counseling. Practitioners will have a customized mobile app to facilitate intervention delivery. Practitioners will also have access to a peer network through WhatsApp. The primary outcome is a 30-day point prevalence abstinence from tobacco. Secondary outcomes for patients and practitioners relate to intervention implementation. The study was funded in June 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study experienced some delays, and practitioner recruitment commenced in November 2023. As of July 2024, all practitioners have been recruited, and practitioner recruitment and training are complete. Furthermore, 36% (1687/4688) of patients have been recruited. It is hypothesized that those patients who participated in the LifeFirst SWASTH program will be more likely to have been abstinent from tobacco for 30 consecutive days by the end of 6 months or at least decreased their tobacco use. LifeFirst SWASTH, if found to be effective in terms of cessation outcomes and implementation, has the potential to be scaled to other settings in India and other low- and middle-income countries. The study will be conducted in low-resource settings and will reach many patients, which will increase the impact if scaled. It will use task-shifting and an app that can be tailored to different settings, also enabling scalability. Findings will build the literature for translating evidence-based interventions from high-income countries to low- and middle-income countries and from high- to low-resource settings.

Early suspicion and intervention are essential, especially in tuberculosis-endemic regions. Rapid initiation of anti-tuberculosis therapy and vigilant monitoring for complications, such as hydrocephalus, improve patient outcomes and prevent long-term disabilities. This case study provides a comprehensive overview of the difficulties associated with predicting and managing tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The predictive aspect is hindered by the subacute nature of TBM, featuring a prodromal phase lasting 7-10 days, followed by manifestations like severe headaches, altered mental status, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cranial neuropathies. Additionally, vision loss is a disabling complication. All components of the visual pathway, especially the optic nerve and optic chiasma, are frequently and dominantly affected. While antibiotics can promptly resolve meningitis in most cases, approximately 10% of infections progress to chronic meningitis, with tuberculosis meningitis being the most common form. Our patient initially presented with nonspecific symptoms, which later evolved into symptoms that indicate viral meningitis and was started on empirical therapy.

Delays in diagnosing TB or Diabetes would lead to adverse outcomes among comorbid patients, and attempts must be made to reduce these delays. Against this background, the study has been undertaken to clarify the role of sociocultural factors in determining diagnostic delays for TB and Diabetes among comorbid patients. A cross-sectional cultural epidemiological survey of the randomly selected 180 TB-Diabetes comorbid patients was carried out. The study examined sociocultural factors of delayed diagnosis of TB and Diabetes among urban and rural TB-Diabetes comorbid patients registered under TB-Diabetes collaborative activities under the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) in the Satara district of Maharashtra by using a semi-structured interview schedule. The patterns of distress (PDs) and perceived causes(PCs) of TB and Diabetes were compared with patients' and providers' diagnostic delays of TB and Diabetes based on prominence categories. In addition, the relationship between PDs and PCs as explanatory variables and TB and Diabetes diagnostic delays as outcome variables were assessed using stepwise multiple logistic regression. Of the 180 TB-Diabetes comorbid patients, the proportion of men was higher, and they were 4.7 times more likely to get a delayed Diabetes diagnosis. Those who reported side effects of drugs and stigma reduced social status as the PDs were 2-3 times more likely to delay reaching TB facilities/providers (patients' diagnostic delay). Those who perceived inadequate diet and mental-emotional stress as the causes of TB were about three times more likely to reach the TB providers/facilities after two weeks. Also, those who perceived TB as a cause of punishment for prior deeds were two times more likely to reach TB facilities/providers after two weeks. Patients who reported fever and chest pain as the symptoms of TB were two times more likely to delay the diagnosis of TB.

Medical thoracoscopy may help physicians diagnose such cases. We aimed to study the diagnostic yield of medical thoracoscopy in patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion and assess the safety profile of the medical thoracoscopy. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 105 patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion. Medical thoracoscopy was performed using an Olympus semi-rigid thoracoscope (LTF 160 Evis Pleurovideoscope, Japan) as per standard protocol. Multiple pleural biopsies were taken and sent for histopathology examination, NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test), and MGIT (mycobacteria growth indicator tube). Post-procedure, the patients were evaluated for any complications. A total of 105 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean ± SD age was 55.1 ± 13.6 years. Sixty-three (60%) patients were males. The diagnostic utility of medical thoracoscopy was found in 94 (89.5%) patients. The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) was made in 34 (32.3%) patients, and 48 (45.7%) patients were diagnosed with malignant pleural effusion. Adenocarcinoma of the lung was the most common malignancy diagnosed (32 patients, 66.6%). Five (5.31%) patients had dual etiology of pleural effusion: tubercular and malignancy. The most common complication was chest pain following the procedure (99.4%). One patient developed pneumomediastinum and was managed conservatively. There were no major adverse events after the procedure. Medical thoracoscopy has a high diagnostic yield and favorable safety profile with minimal complications. Excessive reliance on the level of ADA (adenosine deaminase) may further delay the diagnosis.

An estimated 27% of new TB cases and 44% of previously treated TB cases are resistant to at least one anti-TB drug. The conventional methods for DR-TB diagnosis are time-consuming and have limitations, leading to delays in treatment initiation and the spread of the disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches have emerged as a promising tool for diagnosing DR-TB, simultaneously offering rapid and accurate detection of resistance mutations in multiple genes. NGS-based approaches generate a large amount of data, which requires efficient and reliable bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis. TBProfiler and Mykrobe are the bioinformatics pipelines that have been created to analyze NGS data for the diagnosis of DR-TB. These pipelines use reference-based and machine-learning approaches to detect resistance mutations and predict drug susceptibility, enabling clinicians to make informed treatment decisions. Implementing NGS-based approaches and bioinformatics pipelines for DR-TB diagnosis can potentially improve patient outcomes by facilitating early detection of drug resistance and guiding personalized treatment regimens. However, the widespread adoption of these approaches in India faces several challenges, including high costs, limited infrastructure, and a lack of trained personnel.

Rare sites of extrapulmonary tuberculosis include the gastrointestinal tract, musculoskeletal system, genital tract, middle ear and pericardium. Histopathological findings of macro-confluent granuloma with or without caseous necrosis, along with detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, and GeneXpert for detection of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> DNA, are key in establishing a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Biopsy-proven extrapulmonary granulomatous lesions were included in this study. Histopathological evaluation of all extrapulmonary biopsy specimens sent to the Department of Pathology were done for the presence of granuloma and necrosis, and ZN staining for AFB was done in all the cases of granulomatous lesions with or without the presence of necrosis. The same cases, with biopsy specimens sent in normal saline, were re-evaluated in a molecular laboratory with the help of GeneXpert MTB to detect the DNA of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. All biopsy specimens from extrapulmonary sites which were sent to the Department of Pathology were used for DNA extraction. Out of the 10 cases of extrapulmonary granulomatous lesions, 8 showed caseous necrosis on microscopy, and 7 showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen staining. GeneXpert detected DNA of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in 9 cases. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis rarely occurs as primary, and mostly spreads from lung parenchyma via a haematogenous route. Tuberculosis of the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, lymph nodes, and solid viscera are together termed abdominal tuberculosis. Entities like tuberculosis of the pericardium and ear are extremely rare. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis should be a differential in cases of chronic non-responding cases with diagnostic dilemmas. To avoid diagnostic delay, in cases of high suspicion, one should go for biopsy along with ZN staining for diagnostic confirmation as this is cost-effective, followed by GeneXpert for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in highly suspected cases with absent caseous necrosis and negative ZN staining.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Delayed diagnosis of TB contributes to more severe disease manifestations, higher risk of death, and higher disease transmission in the community. We conducted this study to assess the extent and associated reasons for delay in diagnosis of pulmonary TB. This study was conducted in the Department of TB and Respiratory Diseases, J. N. Medical College, Aligarh, from June 2020 to May 2022. A total of 2053 new pulmonary TB patients, who first consulted any private healthcare provider (HCP) for treatment, were enrolled in the study. The required information was collected by interview technique using a predesigned questionnaire. A total of 2053 patients were enrolled in the study. There was a significant delay of more than 2 weeks in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB after the onset of symptoms in 94% of patients. The extent of delay ranged from 8 days to 240 days with a mean of 36.33 days. The delay in visiting the HCPs by the patient was not significant. Only 5.85% of patients had a significant delay of more than 2 weeks in seeking any health care after the appearance of symptoms. A delay by HCP contributed to a greater portion of the total delay, with a mean of 31.77 days. The main reason for the delay by HCPs was not investigating TB. The hospital delay was not significant. The mean hospital delay was 5.82 days. The delay in the diagnosis of TB in India is very high. A delay by HCPs contributes to a greater portion of the total delay.

However, the prevailing anti-tuberculosis therapy, while aiming to combat tuberculosis (TB), also debilitates innate and adaptive immune components of the host. In this study, we explored how the front-line anti-TB drugs impact the host immune cells by modulating multiple signaling pathways and subsequently leading to disease relapse. Administration of these drugs led to a reduction in innate immune activation and also the cytokines required to trigger protective T cell responses. Moreover, these drugs led to activation-induced cell death in the mycobacterial-specific T cell leading to a reduced killing capacity. Furthermore, these drugs stalled the T cell differentiation into memory subsets by modulating the activation of STAT3, STAT4, FOXO1, and NFκB transcription factors and hampering the Th1 and Th17-mediated long-term host protective memory responses. These findings suggest the urgent need to augment directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) therapy with immunomodulatory agents to mitigate the adverse effects linked to the treatment.IMPORTANCEAs a central component of TB eradication initiatives, directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) therapy imparts immune-dampening effects during the course of treatment. This approach undermines the host immune system by delaying the activation process and lowering the immune response. In our investigation, we have unveiled the impact of DOTS on specific immune cell populations. Notably, the signaling pathways involving STAT3 and STAT4 critical for memory responses and NFκβ associated with pro-inflammation were substantially declined due to the therapy. Consequently, these drugs exhibit limited effectiveness in preventing recurrence of the disease.

Many Indians do not navigate all care cascade stages to receive TB treatment and achieve recurrence-free survival. Guided by a population/exposure/comparison/outcomes (PECO) framework, we report findings of a systematic review to identify factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes across each care cascade gap for TB disease in India. We defined care cascade gaps as comprising people with confirmed or presumptive TB who did not: start the TB diagnostic workup (Gap 1), complete the workup (Gap 2), start treatment (Gap 3), achieve treatment success (Gap 4), or achieve TB recurrence-free survival (Gap 5). Three systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1, 2000 to August 14, 2023 were conducted. We identified articles evaluating factors associated with unfavorable outcomes for each gap (reported as adjusted odds, relative risk, or hazard ratios) and, among people experiencing unfavorable outcomes, reasons for these outcomes (reported as proportions), with specific quality or risk of bias criteria for each gap. Findings were organized into person-, family-, and society-, or health system-related factors, using a social-ecological framework. Factors associated with unfavorable outcomes across multiple cascade stages included: male sex, older age, poverty-related factors, lower symptom severity or duration, undernutrition, alcohol use, smoking, and distrust of (or dissatisfaction with) health services. People previously treated for TB were more likely to seek care and engage in the diagnostic workup (Gaps 1 and 2) but more likely to suffer pretreatment loss to follow-up (Gap 3) and unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4), especially those who were lost to follow-up during their prior treatment. For individual care cascade gaps, multiple studies highlighted lack of TB knowledge and structural barriers (e.g., transportation challenges) as contributing to lack of care-seeking for TB symptoms (Gap 1, 14 studies); lack of access to diagnostics (e.g., X-ray), non-identification of eligible people for testing, and failure of providers to communicate concern for TB as contributing to non-completion of the diagnostic workup (Gap 2, 17 studies); stigma, poor recording of patient contact information by providers, and early death from diagnostic delays as contributing to pretreatment loss to follow-up (Gap 3, 15 studies); and lack of TB knowledge, stigma, depression, and medication adverse effects as contributing to unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4, 86 studies). Medication nonadherence contributed to unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4) and TB recurrence (Gap 5, 14 studies). Limitations include lack of meta-analyses due to the heterogeneity of findings and limited generalizability to some Indian regions, given the country's diverse population. This systematic review illuminates common patterns of risk that shape outcomes for Indians with TB, while highlighting knowledge gaps-particularly regarding TB care for children or in the private sector-to guide future research.

Unfortunately, seven patients died, and three experienced relapse. Spinal TB is the most common type of MSTB and is predominant in young and middle-aged adults, while extra-spinal MSTB is more frequently observed in children. Where use of MRI facilitates early detection of spinal TB; histopathological and microbiological examination confirm the diagnosis. Combining anti-tubercular drugs with modern surgical approaches is essential for obtaining favorable outcomes and improving the quality of life of such patients. It is crucial to have advanced and affordable diagnostic facilities, along with increased public awareness, to reinforce tuberculosis control strategies.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

However, the involvement of various extrapulmonary sites is due to the spread of the bacteria via blood, lymphatic, or direct inoculation. The present case is a rare presentation of tuberculosis in an Indian female who came with complaints of swelling in her right elbow joint, headache, and cough with expectoration. A diagnostic evaluation resulted in the isolation of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> from the sputum samples and elbow joints, which was further supported by an exudative picture on the cerebrospinal fluid examination. The findings were supported by advanced radiometric techniques. She was commenced on an antituberculous treatment per her weight.

It is the leading cause of death among communicable diseases and the fifth leading cause of all diseases in India. The diagnosis can be challenging due to the disease's unique appearance and various presentations. Disseminated TB is characterized by the involvement of two or more non-contiguous sites resulting from hematogenous extension of the disease. Clinical confirmation of the diagnosis of disseminated TB is based on bacteriological or histological evidence. Based on various studies, there is evidence that satisfactory results are obtained from treatment with first-line anti-tubercular drugs. When there is a delay in diagnosis and treatment, it can become a life-threatening condition. We present a case of a 38-year-old alcoholic male who presented with generalized edema, pain, and distension of the abdomen. According to the initial presentation, the provisional diagnosis made was alcoholic liver disease, but it was later diagnosed as disseminated TB with sputum-positive pulmonary TB with abdominal involvement in the form of ascites and hepatosplenomegaly along with hematological involvement as pancytopenia.

Our recent nationwide evaluation of implementation and utilization of NPY using programmatic data of PwTB from nine randomly selected Indian states, reported a 70% coverage and high median delay in benefit credit. We undertook a qualitative study between January and July 2023, to understand the detailed implementation process of NPY and explore the enablers and barriers to effective implementation and utilization of the NPY scheme. We followed a grounded theory approach to inductively develop theoretical explanations for social phenomena through data generated from multiple sources. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews of national, district and field-level staff of the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) and NPY beneficiaries from 30 districts across nine states of India, selected using theoretical sampling. An analytical framework developed through inductive coding of a set of six interviews, guided the coding of the subsequent interviews. Categories and themes emerged through constant comparison and the data collection continued until theoretical saturation. Stakeholders perceived NPY as a beneficial initiative. Strong political commitment from the state administration, mainstreaming of NTEP work with the district public healthcare delivery system, availability of good geographic and internet connectivity and state-specific grievance redressal mechanisms and innovations were identified as enablers of implementation. However, the complex, multi-level benefit approval process, difficulties in accessing banking services, perceived inadequacy of benefits and overworked human resources in the NTEP were identified as barriers to implementation and utilization. The optimal utilization of NPY is enabled by strong political commitment and challenged by its lengthy implementation process and delayed disbursal of benefits. We recommend greater operational simplicity in NPY implementation, integrating NTEP activities with the public health system to reduce the burden on the program staff, and revising the benefit amount more equitably.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Extrapulmonary TB is less common. Musculoskeletal organs are affected in around 8% of all tubercular patients, of which the spine is affected in almost half of the patients. The criteria for diagnosing spinal TB are quite difficult and we use an array of investigations for the same. A retrospective study was carried out in the Neurosurgery and Microbiology Department at IMS and SUM Hospital between January 2021 and November 2023, and data were collected and tabulated in an Excel sheet. One hundred patients with spinal TB were evaluated, and their age, sex, samples sent, diagnostic investigation, duration of diagnosis from hospital admission, histopathology results, and surgical intervention (done or not) were recorded. The best investigation done to diagnose spinal TB was imaging and surgical/computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy. The earliest result to diagnose spinal TB was histopathology. The yield of positivity in pus culture, smear microscopy, and true nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) was found to be low even though sensitivity was on the higher side. Even though we have an array of investigations for diagnosing spinal TB, the best and the earliest diagnosing test was imaging plus CT-guided biopsy. The confirmation is made in the biopsy. Finding acid-fast bacteria (AFB) and NAAT tests are additional beneficial tests to supplement the diagnosis. Hence, we can conclude that sending for tests like AFB in pus, NAAT, and GeneXpert is a wastage of biological samples and delays in diagnosis.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy set a milestone of achieving zero catastrophic cost by 2020. However, a recent literature review noted that 7%-32% TB affected households in India faced catastrophic cost. Studies included in the review were small scale cross-sectional. We followed a cohort of 1482 notified drug-susceptible TB patients from four states in India: Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal to provide a comprehensive picture of economic burden associated with TB treatment. Treatment cost was calculated using World Health Organization guidelines on TB patient cost survey and both human capital and output approaches of indirect cost (time, productivity, and income loss related to an episode) calculation were used to provide the range of households currently facing catastrophic cost. Depending on choice of indirect cost calculation method, 30%-61% study participants faced catastrophic cost. For over half of them, costs became catastrophic even before starting TB treatment as there was average 7-9 weeks delay from symptom onset to treatment initiation which was double the generally accepted delay of 4 weeks. During that period, they made average 8-11 visits to different providers and spent money on consultations, drugs, tests, and travel. Following the largest cohort of drug-susceptible TB patients till date, the study concluded that a significant proportion of study participants faced catastrophic cost and the proportion was much higher when income loss was considered as indirect cost calculation method. Therefore, ensuring uninterrupted livelihood during TB treatment is an absolute necessity. Another reason of high cost was the delay in diagnosis and costs incurred during pre-diagnosis period. This delay and consequently, economic burden, can be reduced by both supply side (intense private sector engagement, rapid diagnosis) and demand side (community engagement) initiatives. Reimbursement of expenses incurred before treatment initiation could be used as short-term measure for mitigating financial hardship.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Mutations in genes affecting drug metabolism explain considerable interindividual pharmacokinetic variability; however, pharmacogenomic assays that predict metabolism of antitubercular drugs have been lacking. <b>Objectives:</b> We sought to develop a Nanopore sequencing panel and validate its performance in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) to personalize treatment dosing. <b>Methods:</b> We developed a Nanopore sequencing panel targeting 15 SNPs in five genes affecting the metabolism of antitubercular drugs. For validation, we sequenced DNA samples (<i>n</i> = 48) from the 1,000 Genomes Project and compared the variant calling accuracy with that of Illumina genome sequencing. We then sequenced DNA samples from patients with active TB (<i>n</i> = 100) from South Africa on a MinION Mk1C and evaluated the relationship between genotypes and pharmacokinetic parameters for isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF). <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> The pharmacogenomic panel achieved 100% concordance with Illumina sequencing in variant identification for the samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project. In the clinical cohort, coverage was more than 100× for 1,498 of 1,500 (99.8%) amplicons across the 100 samples.

Genomics of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) from clinical samples enables detection of drug resistance to multiple drugs. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for 600 clinical samples from patients with tuberculosis to identify the drug-resistance profile and mutation spectrum. We documented the reasons reported by clinicians for referral. WGS identified a high proportion (51%) of pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) cases followed by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (15.5%). This correlates with the primary reason for referral, as non-response to the first-line treatment (67%) and treatment failure or rifampicin resistance (14%). Multivariate analysis indicated that all young age groups (<i>P</i> < 0.05), male gender (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and Beijing strain (<i>P</i> < 0.01) were significant independent predictors of MDR-TB or MDR-TB+ [pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and XDR-TB]. Ser315Thr (72.5%) in the <i>inhA</i> gene and Ser450Leu in the <i>rpoB</i> gene (65.5%) were the most prevalent mutations, as were resistance-conferring mutations to pyrazinamide (41%) and streptomycin (61.33%). Mutations outside the rifampicin resistance-determining region (RRDR), Ile491Phe and Val170Phe, were seen in 1.3% of cases; disputed mutations in <i>rpoB</i> (Asp435Tyr, His445Asn, His445Leu, and Leu430Pro) were seen in 6% of cases, and mutations to newer drugs such as bedaquiline and linezolid in 1.0% and 7.5% of cases, respectively. This study on clinical samples highlights that there is a high proportion of pre-XDR cases and emerging resistance to newer drugs; ongoing transmission of these strains can cause serious threat to public health; and whole-genome sequencing can effectively identify and support precision medicine for TB. The current study is based on real-world data on the TB drug-resistance profile by whole-genome sequencing of 600 clinical samples from patients with TB in India. This study indicates the clinicians' reasons for sending samples for WGS, which is for difficult-to-treat cases and/or relapse and treatment failure. The study reports a significant proportion of cases with pre-XDR-TB strains that warrant policy makers' attention. It reflects the current iterative nature of the diagnostic tests under programmatic conditions that leads to delays in appropriate diagnosis and empirical treatment. India had an estimated burden of 2.95 million TB cases in 2020 and 135,000 multidrug-resistant cases. However, WGS profiles of <i>M.tb</i> from India remains disproportionately poorly represented. This study adds a significant body of data on the mutation profiles seen in <i>M.tb</i> isolated from patients with TB in India, mutations outside the RRDR, disputed mutations, and resistance-conferring mutations to newer drugs such as bedaquiline and linezolid.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

This is followed by the induction of cellular stress responses in the host. Such cells can either undergo various cell death processes such as apoptosis or necrosis, or mount effective immune responses to clear the invading pathogen. Further, to combat the infection progression, the host secretes extracellular vesicles such as exosomes to initiate immune signaling. The exosomes can contain <i>M.tb</i> as well as host cell-derived peptides that can act as a double-edged sword in the immune signaling event. The host-symbiont microbiota produces various metabolites that are beneficial for maintaining healthy tissue microenvironment. In juxtaposition to the above-mentioned mechanisms, <i>M.tb</i> dysregulates the gut and respiratory microbiome to support its replication and dissemination process. The above-mentioned interconnected host cellular processes of Immunometabolism, Cellular stress, Host Microbiome, and Extracellular vesicles are less explored in the realm of exploration of novel Host-directed therapies for TB. Therefore, this review highlights the intertwined host cellular processes to control <i>M.tb</i> survival and showcases the important factors that can be targeted for designing efficacious therapy.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

It can be challenging to diagnose owing to its vague presentations, and its possibility is often overlooked. Tubercular peritonitis and peritoneal carcinomatosis are the 2 crucial differential diagnoses that need to be taken into account. However, making a clinical differentiation between these 2 entities is challenging and necessitates a careful histopathological and microbiological analysis. <i>Case Presentation.</i> In this report, we present the case of a 28-year-old female who developed granulomatous peritonitis following a right ovarian cystectomy. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination. <i>Conclusion.</i> We must be aware of this rare entity, which, if left untreated, could have serious consequences, and consider its possibility in cases where the patient complains of abdominal pain after any abdominal procedure.

Five years after its implementation, we conducted the first nationwide evaluation of NPY. In our retrospective cohort study using programmatic data of patients notified with TB in nine randomly selected Indian states between 2018 and 2022, we estimated the proportion of patients who received at least one NPY instalment and the median time to receive the first instalment. We determined the factors associated (i) with non-receipt of NPY using a generalised linear model with Poisson family and log link and (ii) with time taken to receive first NPY benefit in 2022 using quantile regression at 50th percentile. Overall, 3,712,551 patients were notified between 2018 and 2022. During this period, the proportion who received at least one NPY instalment had increased from 56.9% to 76.1%. Non-receipt was significantly higher among patients notified by private sector (aRR 2.10;2.08,2.12), reactive for HIV (aRR 1.69;1.64,1.74) and with missing/undetermined diabetic status (aRR 2.02;1.98,2.05).

The prolonged therapy of TB can delay kidney transplantation in patients on antitubercular therapy (ATT). This was a retrospective single-center study to analyze the safety of kidney transplantation and its outcomes in patients undergoing transplantation while on the continuation phase of ATT. Between 2013 and 2022, 30 patients underwent kidney transplantation while on ATT. Median age was 38 years and 70% were males. Majority of the patients (86.7%) had extrapulmonary tuberculosis, most common site of involvement being tubercular lymphadenitis. 14/30 patients had microbiological/histopathological diagnosis of TB and the rest were diagnosed by ancillary tests. Patients were treated with 4 drug ATT (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) before transplantation for aminimum of 2 months. Post-transplantation fluoroquinolone-based non-rifamycin ATT was used (median duration 11 months). All patients completed therapy. At 2 years, there was 100% patient survival and 96.7% graft survival. Median eGFR at 6, 12, and 24 months post-transplantation was 71.9, 64.7, and 67 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The percentage of patients suffering a biopsy proven acute rejection at 6, 12, and 24 months was 3.3%, 6.7%, and 6.7%.

The study utilized a qualitative design through in-depth interviews of private practitioners and was conducted in Ranchi and Purbi Singhbhum District of Jharkhand State from March-August 2021. The pilot-tested, semi-structured, open-ended interview guide questionnaire collected information from private practitioners on various aspects of the TB care cascade. The data from the provider interviews were transcribed into multiple codes and themes on the TB program. An inductive analysis was carried out with a focus on content credibility to eliminate bias. Ethical approval was received from the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar (IIPHG), India. Written consent was taken from the private practitioners involved in the study. In-depth interviews of 17 private practitioners reveal various factors contributing to delays in TB care cascades, especially delay in access to TB diagnosis and TB Care, delay in providing treatment once after diagnosis and poor adherence to the TB treatment. According to the perception of private practitioners, there was an array of client, provider and system side factors affecting the TB care cascade gaps positively and negatively. Positive aspects mainly emerged from interviews: strong governance, consistent supply chain management, innovative PPP models and financial schemes reducing out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE). Various factors affecting the TB care cascade negatively include awareness among the patient, socio-economic status, approach and decision-making power of providers, adverse effects of drugs, staff capacity building, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging private practitioner in TB elimination efforts is critical to achieving global targets and reducing the burden of TB.

We interviewed 128 (56 men and 72 women) individuals who had MDR-TB, aged > = 15 years, registered and treated under the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) in Pune city of India. We carried out thematic analysis of participants' narratives. We found that delays in diagnosis, lack of counseling, late referral to the NTEP and unwarranted expenditure were the main barriers to care that study participants experienced in the private sector. Provider dismissal of symptoms, non-courteous behavior, lack of hygiene in the referral centers, forced stay with other patients and lack of support for psychological/psychiatric problems were identified as a few additional challenges that participants faced at the NTEP care centers. Using qualitative data from experiences of participants with MDR-TB, we identify patients' several unmet needs, attention to which can improve MDR-TB care. Educating private providers about MDR-TB risk and available rapid molecular assays can help the timely diagnosis of MDR-TB and reduce patients' out of pocket costs. At the RNTCP/NTEP, measures such as training health workers to build rapport with patients, maintaining hygienic environments in the health centers with adequate isolation of participants with MDR from other serious cases, referral of patients with psychiatric symptoms to mental health specialists and monitoring drug shortages can help in improving care delivery.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Here, we report the temporal dynamics of the proteome of macrophage-like host cells after infecting them for 6, 18, 30, and 42 h with two laboratory strains (H37Ra and H37Rv) and two clinical strains (BND433 and JAL2287) of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB). Using SWATH-MS, the proteins characterized at the onset of infection broadly represented oxidative stress and cell cytoskeleton processes. Intermediary and later stages of infection are accompanied by a reshaping of the combination of proteins implicated in histone stability, gene expression, and protein trafficking. This study provides strain-specific and time-specific variations in the proteome of the host, which might further the development of host-directed therapeutics and diagnostic tools against the pathogen. Also, our findings accentuate the importance of proteomic tools in delineating the complex recalibration of the host defence enabled as an effect of MTB infection.

This study identified patient and physician determined reasons for diagnostic delays. <b>Materials and Method</b> s This was an observational cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care institution in South India, for 12 months. From 207 consecutively selected patients, with a presumptive lung cancer diagnosis, 150 were enrolled utilizing a prefixed questionnaire. The time intervals from appreciation of initial respiratory symptoms to a final tissue diagnosis were defined sequentially as approach interval, referral interval, and diagnostic interval and factors causing delay in each interval were identified. <b>Results</b>  In a state with 100% literacy, the mean time to approach a doctor was 8 weeks (range: 0-336 days; SD: 7.95) with a delay seen in 52% of the study group. Referring a suspect lung cancer diagnosis to a specialist, took an average of 4.98 weeks (range: 1-26 weeks; SD: 5.64) with referral delays in 47.3% of patients. The mean diagnostic interval was 9.21 days (range: 3-41 days; SD: 7.18) and 16.7% of cases had diagnostic delays in spite of a definite procedure. <b>Conclusion</b>  In a tuberculosis endemic location, empirical treatment with anti-tuberculosis therapy and prolonged antibiotic courses without serially monitoring the course of disease are responsible for referral delays. Also, 88.2% of the total females studied, presented late due to family and work pressures, fear of being stigmatized and being on prolonged home remedies.

The National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) in India introduced this novel tool at the district and subdistrict level in 2020. This study aimed to assess the level and causes of inconclusive results (invalid results, errors, and indeterminate results) in MTB and RIF testing at NTEP sites and the root causes of these in the programmatic setting. Truenat testing data from 1,690 functional Truenat sites under the NTEP from April to June 2021 were analyzed to assess the rates of errors, invalid MTB results, and indeterminate RIF results. Following this analysis, 12 Truenat sites were selected based on site performance in Truenat testing, diversity of climatic conditions, and geographical terrain. These sites were visited to assess the root causes of their high and low rates of inconclusive results using a structured checklist. A total of 327,649 Truenat tests performed for MTB and RIF testing were analyzed. The rate of invalid MTB results was 5.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.11-5.26; <i>n</i> = 16,998] and the rate of errors was 2.5% (95% CI: 2.46-2.57; <i>n</i> = 8,240) in Truenat MTB chip testing. For Mtb-positive samples tested using the Truenat RIF chip for detection of RIF resistance (<i>n</i> = 40,926), the rate of indeterminate results was 15.3% (95% CI: 14.97-15.67; <i>n</i> = 6,267) and the rate of errors was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.53-1.78; <i>n</i> = 675). There was a 40.1% retesting gap for Mtb testing and a 78.2% gap for inconclusive RR results. Among the inconclusive results retested, 27.9% (95% CI: 27.23-28.66; <i>n</i> = 4,222) were Mtb-positive, and 9.2% (95% CI: 7.84-10.76; <i>n</i> = 139) were detected as RR. The main causes affecting Truenat testing performance include suboptimal adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs), inadequate training, improper storage of testing kits, inadequate sputum quality, lack of quality control, and delays in the rectification of machine issues. Root cause analysis identified that strengthening of training, external quality control, and supervision could improve the rate of inconclusive results. Ensuring hands-on training of technicians for Truenat testing and retesting of samples with inconclusive results are major recommendations while planning for Truenat scale-up.

A Non-Randomized, Observational Pilot Study.","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Ram B Singh; Alex Tarnava; Ghizal Fatima; Jan Fedacko; Viliam Mojto; Tyler W LeBaron,"Recently, chronic lung diseases have been found to be associated with marked inflammation and oxidative stress, which leads to fibrosis in the lungs and chronic respiratory failure. This study aims to determine if hydrogen-rich water (HRW) can enhance oxygen saturation among patients with chronic lung diseases. Ten patients with chronic lung diseases due to COPD (<i>n</i> = 7), bronchial asthma (<i>n</i> = 2), and tuberculosis of the lung (<i>n</i> = 1) with oxygen saturation of 90-95% were provided high-concentration (>5 mM) HRW using H<sub>2</sub>-producing tablets for 4 weeks. Oxygen saturation was measured via oximeter and blood pressure via digital automatic BP recorder. HRW administration was associated with a significant increase in oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and decrease in TBARS, MDA, and diene conjugates, with an increase in vitamin E and nitrite levels, compared to baseline levels. Physical training carried out after HRW therapy appeared to increase exercise tolerance and decrease hypoxia, as well as delay the need for oxygen therapy. Treatment with HRW in patients with hypoxia from chronic lung diseases may decrease oxidative stress and improve oxygen saturation in some patients. HRW therapy may also provide increased exercise tolerance in patients with chronic hypoxia, but further research is needed.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

PR in LNTB may be wrongly considered as treatment failure or relapse. This review was undertaken to address various aspects of PR associated with LNTB prevalence, underlying mechanisms, clinical patterns, predictors, and possible treatment in an immunocompetent individual. A literature review was performed using various databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) to identify relevant articles for review. The prevalence of PR associated with LNTB varies from as low as 13.3% to as high as 35.3%. PR may occur during antitubercular treatment or be reported even after completion of treatment, called post-therapy PR. An onset of PR may occur within a month of therapy to even 12 months from the initiation of an anti-tubercular drug. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction and reduction in immune suppression are believed to be possible mechanisms leading to a PR. PR in LNTB is characterized by either progression of pre-existing nodal enlargement or formation of abscess, sinus formation, or appearance of new nodal enlargement, or rarely extra-nodal involvement. PR is a diagnosis of exclusion and may show granuloma, positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, or positive GeneXpert, but AFB culture is always negative. Younger age, lymph node size of equal to or more than 3 cm, female gender, unilateral lymphadenopathy, and those with positive AFB on initial examination are predictors for PR in peripheral LNTB.

Mutations in genes affecting drug metabolism explain considerable interindividual pharmacokinetic variability; however, pharmacogenomic (PGx) assays that predict metabolism of anti-TB drugs have been lacking. To develop a Nanopore sequencing panel and validate its performance in active TB patients to personalize treatment dosing. We developed a Nanopore sequencing panel targeting 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 5 genes affecting the metabolism of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), linezolid and bedaquiline. For validation, we sequenced DNA samples (n=48) from the 1000 genomes project and compared variant calling accuracy with Illumina genome sequencing. We then sequenced DNA samples from patients with active TB (n=100) from South Africa on a MinION Mk1C and evaluated the relationship between genotypes and pharmacokinetic parameters for INH and RIF. The PGx panel achieved 100% concordance with Illumina sequencing in variant identification for the samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. In the clinical cohort, coverage was >100x for 1498/1500 (99.8%) amplicons across the 100 samples. One third (33%) of participants were identified as slow, 47% were intermediate and 20% were rapid isoniazid acetylators. Isoniazid clearance was significantly impacted by acetylator status (p<0.0001) with median (IQR) clearances of 11.2 L/h (9.3-13.4), 27.2 L/h (22.0-31.7), and 45.1 L/h (34.1-51.1) in slow, intermediate, and rapid acetylators.

Melioidosis manifests diversely in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening respiratory distress, septic shock, localized tissue infection, necrotizing pneumonia, and soft organ abscesses.  Methods: An 18-month observational study was conducted at a tertiary center in central India among various confirmed melioidosis cases, with data gathered and analyzed. Aerobic culture and sensitivity were performed in all studied cases, either in blood/body fluid/localized collection - using blood agar media for the culture and disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar for sensitivity. Other tests, such as radiological imaging, were conducted according to symptoms and signs of localized infection. The melioidosis cases under study were compared on various clinical/presenting parameters. Melioidosis has a variety of risk factors, but we found that, in India, diabetic patients are at a higher risk of this infection, particularly fatal forms, as all of the patients in our study were diabetic. Melioidosis is known to have joint involvement, either as a source of infection or later in the course of the disease. All cases were successfully treated with antibiotics and surgical procedures, demonstrating the significance of determining disease etiology, early diagnosis, and rapid early management.  Melioidosis is a potentially fatal disease, particularly in diabetics, with a wide range of symptoms and complications. Physicians face a variety of challenges, including clinical symptoms resembling other chronic illnesses, such as tuberculosis, delays in laboratory confirmation, underdiagnosis, reduced reporting, and a lack of suspicion. Because there are very little data and it is a seldom reported infection from central India, we are publishing a study on seven melioidosis patients.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Pulmonary nocardiosis in apparently immunocompetent individuals is uncommon. Here, we present the case of an elderly gentleman with a background history of poorly controlled diabetes but no history of systemic steroid use who presented with worsening symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the form of productive cough and dyspnea. The patient had diffuse crepitations in bilateral lung fields and an arterial oxygen saturation of 86% at admission. Sputum microscopy revealed gram-positive filamentous bacteria that could be successfully cultured and identified as Nocardia amamiensis on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the lungs revealed cavitary nodules and consolidation. The patient responded well to treatment with specific antibiotics based on sensitivity patterns.

It presents unique diagnostic challenges due to its nonspecific clinical features and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. This study aimed to investigate the clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and prognosis of foot tuberculosis, with the goal of improving early recognition and appropriate intervention. A prospective study was conducted between November 2016 and July 2021, involving 39 patients diagnosed with foot tuberculosis. Clinical examinations, laboratory tests, X-rays, and MRI evaluations were performed to aid in the diagnosis. Biopsy was conducted on patients with radiological lesions. Patients were treated with an 18-month course of antitubercular therapy (ATT). Foot Function Index (FFI) scores were recorded before and after treatment. Statistical analysis was conducted to assess factors impacting prognosis. Unilateral foot involvement was observed in all patients, with a male predominance (61.5%) and a mean age of 31.3 years. The most common symptoms were pain and edema, with sinus tracts present in 17.9% of patients. Radiographic findings showed cystic and sclerotic lesions, with the ""spina ventosa"" appearance primarily affecting the metatarsal bones. MRI played a valuable role in early detection. Histopathological examination confirmed tuberculosis in all cases, and acid-fast bacilli were found in 23% of patients. Most patients (79.4%) responded well to ATT without requiring surgery. Factors such as high initial ESR, delayed ATT initiation, multiple lesions, and tarsal involvement were associated with unfavourable outcomes. Foot tuberculosis presents with nonspecific symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in appropriate treatment. Clinical examination, radiographic evaluation, and biopsy are essential for accurate diagnosis. Early initiation of ATT is crucial for favourable outcomes. Factors such as high initial ESR, delayed treatment initiation, multiple lesions, and tarsal involvement negatively impact prognosis. This study highlights the importance of recognizing foot tuberculosis and provides insights into its clinical presentation, radiographic features, and treatment outcomes, facilitating timely intervention and improved patient management.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

In this context, we conducted a study in Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala to ascertain the ability of those suffering from TB to follow treatment guidelines. This study used an embedded mixed methods design. We collected cross-sectional data from 135 drug sensitive pulmonary TB patients aged 18 years or above in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala using a structured questionnaire to get the proportion of patients following all treatment guidelines. We also did eight in-depth interviews (four men and four women) from within the survey sample. The in-depth interviews were inductively analysed for getting deeper insights about reasons for the choices people made regarding the treatment guidelines. Written informed consent was taken from all participants and the study was implemented after the necessary programmatic and ethical clearances. Of the 105 men and 30 women studied, uninterrupted daily drug consumption was reported by 80 persons (59.3%, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 50.8-67.2%).

The slow progress of tuberculous osteomyelitis, due to lack of significant elevations in the laboratory values and changes in the radiographic appearance, often leads to confusion with brodie's abscess. These two clinical conditions often lead to delay in diagnosis and progressive bone destruction. The aim of this report was to highlight recognizing the possibility of coinfections in tuberculous osteomyelitis and early treatment targeting both organisms simultaneously. We report a case of a 24-year-old male patient from Kerala, India presented with pain and swelling over distal leg for 2 weeks along with mild fever for 1 month. Imaging showed a brodie's abscess over distal tibia. Pus culture isolated S. Agalactiae. Bone biopsy reported as necrotizing granulomatous lesion. Computed tomography thorax was suggestive of necrotic tuberculous mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Based on histopathology, microbiology, and radiological findings, coinfection of tuberculous osteomyelitis and bacterial infection was confirmed and antitubercular therapy was started, along with antibiotics for S. agalactiae. Tuberculous osteomyelitis mimicking brodie's abscess is very rare.

While there are studies available on the socioeconomic, cultural and gender-related dimensions of TB diagnosis delays among female patients in India, intersections of gender, informal work and diagnosis delays are not sufficiently studied. The present study aims to fill this gap by examining the TB diagnosis delay that are linked to the contingencies of working in informal arrangements for women from lower socio economic background. The study draws on 80 qualitative in-depth interviews conducted among female patients from lower socio-economic background, who were working or recently stopped working in informal arrangements and undergoing Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) treatment in Bengaluru (India) city and 60 willing significant others of the patients. The participants were identified through a scoping survey that covered 188 female patients from 18 DOTS centres in the city. Other than the already known reasons for the delay in TB diagnosis for women such as normalisation of symptoms, stigma and the gender-related discrimination leading to low prioritisation of women's illness, the present study identifies reasons related to work informality. These are normalisation of symptoms as workplace health problems; work related concerns that restricted formal help seeking; non TB specific narratives of symptoms, often incorrectly assumed to be work related health issues or comorbidities and thus confounding the early accurate diagnosis by the medical personnel and shifting between formal and informal systems of help-seeking. Further, the study found that mere knowledge of TB symptoms did not always translate to early diagnosis for patients from the lower socioeconomic groups working in informal arrangements due to the fear of losing work and wages owing to hospital visits. The workplace focus, especially the informal sector where a huge majority of India's workforce is employed, is notably absent in the TB elimination programme. The study indicates the need to adopt a comprehensive approach in the ongoing TB elimination programme in India in which family, living environment and workplace should be integral parts.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

GITB is often considered a disease of the developing world, while CD and inflammatory bowel disease are considered a disease of the developed world. But in recent times, the epidemiology of both diseases has changed. Differentiating GITB from CD is of immense clinical importance as the management of both diseases differs. While GITB needs anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), CD needs immunosuppressive therapy. Misdiagnosis or a delay in diagnosis can lead to catastrophic consequences. Most of the clinical features, endoscopic findings, and imaging features are not pathognomonic for either of these two conditions. The definitive diagnosis of GITB can be clinched only in a fraction of cases with microbiological positivity (acid-fast bacilli, mycobacterial culture, or PCR-based tests). In most cases, the diagnosis is often based on consistent clinical, endoscopic, imaging, and histological findings. Similarly, no single finding can conclusively diagnose CD. Multiparametric-based predictive models incorporating clinical, endoscopy findings, histology, radiology, and serology have been used to differentiate GITB from CD with varied results. However, it is limited by the lack of validation studies for most such models. Many patients, especially in TB endemic regions, are initiated on a trial of ATT to see for an objective response to therapy. Early mucosal response assessed at two months is an objective marker of response to ATT. Prolonged ATT in CD is recognized to have a fibrotic effect. Therefore, early discrimination may be vital in preventing the delay in the diagnosis of CD and avoiding a complicated course.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Rv1830 is one such conserved TR, which remains uncharacterized in Mtb. It was named as McdR based on an effect on cell division upon its overexpression in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Recently, it has been implicated in antibiotic resilience in Mtb and reannotated as ResR. While Rv1830 affects cell division by modulating the expression of M. smegmatis whiB2, the underlying cause of its essentiality and regulation of drug resilience in Mtb is yet to be deciphered. Here we show that ResR/McdR, encoded by ERDMAN_2020 in virulent Mtb Erdman, is pivotal for bacterial proliferation and crucial metabolic activities. Importantly, ResR/McdR directly regulates ribosomal gene expression and protein synthesis, requiring distinct disordered N-terminal sequence. Compared to control, bacteria depleted with resR/mcdR exhibit delayed recovery post-antibiotic treatment. A similar effect upon knockdown of rplN operon genes further implicates ResR/McdR-regulated protein translation machinery in attributing drug resilience in Mtb. Overall, findings from this study suggest that chemical inhibitors of ResR/McdR may be proven effective as adjunctive therapy for shortening the duration of TB treatment.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is a significant pharmacokinetic parameter since it calculates the drug's total systematic exposure in the body. However, multiple blood samples from the patient are required to calculate the area under the curve, which is inconvenient for both the patient and the healthcare professional. To alleviate the issue, the limited sampling strategy (LSS) was devised, in which sampling is minimized while obtaining complete and precise findings to anticipate the area under the curve. One can reduce costs, labor, and discomfort for patients and healthcare workers by applying this limited sampling strategy. This article examines a systematic evaluation of all the limited sampling done in anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) medications resulting from the literature search of several research papers. This article also briefly describes the two methodologies: Multiple regression analysis (MRA) and the Bayesian approach used to develop a limited sampling strategy model. Anti-TB medications have been found to have considerable inter-individual variability, and isoniazid has a narrow therapeutic index, both of which are criteria for therapeutic drug monitoring. To avoid multi-drug resistance and therapy failure, it is proposed that limited sampling strategy-based therapeutic drug monitoring of anti-TB medications be undertaken to generate an individualized dose regimen, particularly for individuals at high risk of treatment failure or delayed response.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

The objective of this clinical case report is to highlight that this unusual condition can occur in the early postoperative period and medical management may completely cure the condition. A middle-aged female who was being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis underwent exploratory laparotomy with limited ileal resection and a loop ileostomy for multiple ileal perforations. Postoperatively, she was restarted on anti-tubercular drugs (ATD) but developed a drug reaction, recurrent bilious vomiting, and jaundice and ATD had to be stopped. But her vomiting did not abate and she progressively developed septicemia. An abdominal CT scan diagnosed Wilkie's syndrome, and she was managed non-operatively by decubitus, parenteral nutrition, and nasojejunal tube feeding supplemented with prokinetics and antibiotics. But her sepsis did not resolve. Intraoperative histopathology suggested Candida infection, and she recovered only after systemic antifungal therapy. Debilitation conditions like tuberculosis cause weight loss and loss of intra-abdominal fat pad, which is known to precipitate SMA syndrome. However, its presentation in the early post-operative period is rare. Symptoms may vary from non-specific abdominal fullness and weight loss to features of acute bowel obstruction. CECT of whole abdomen can help in confirming the diagnosis. SMA syndrome is often not considered in differential diagnosis and can delay treatment. Medical management is the mainstay treatment option, although surgery is reserved for cases, which fail medical treatment. High suspicion is needed to diagnose SMA syndrome in the postoperative period, which precipitates with intractable bilious vomiting. Medical management may be curative. The precipitating factor for SMA syndrome should also be addressed to improve the overall patient outcome.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

Although it can cause secondary damage to the appendix, primary type of appendicular TB is rare and can occur with no other signs of the disease. A high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment of TB. Similarly, stump appendicitis (SA) is a rare and delayed complication of appendectomy. Here we report a case of primary appendicular TB in a patient presented to a multi-specialty hospital in Kerala, India, with SA.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

The higher prevalence of anemia among TB patients is concerning due to its association with delayed sputum conversion and poor treatment outcomes. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of anemia with sputum smear conversion and treatment outcomes among TB patients. In a prospective community-based cohort study, TB patients were recruited from 63 primary health centers in the district. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at 2 months, and at the end of 6 months. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 15. Out of 661 patients recruited, anemia was observed among 503 (76.1%) participants. Prevalence of anemia was more among males 387 (76.9%) than 116 (23.1%) females. Out of 503 anemic patients, 334 (66.4%) had mild, 166 (33.0%) had moderate, and 3 (0.6%) had severe anemia at baseline. At 6-month treatment completion, 16 (6.3%) were still anemic. Among 503 anemic patients, 445 (88.4%) were given iron supplements and remaining 58 (11.6%) were managed with diet modifications. After completion of TB treatment, 495 (98.4%) patients had favorable treatment outcomes, whereas 8 (1.6%) patients had died. Severe anemia was not associated with poor outcomes. The presence of anemia among newly diagnosed TB patients, especially pulmonary TB was high. Increased risk of anemia was noted among males who were alcohol and tobacco consumers.

Renal involvement occurs less frequently in late-onset SLE than in reproductive-age SLE patients. Here, we aimed to study the clinical, serological and histopathological characteristics of late-onset lupus nephritis (LN). Late-onset LN was defined as disease onset after 47 years of age, corresponding to the average menopausal age. Records of biopsy proven late-onset lupus nephritis patients diagnosed between June 2000 and June 2020 were reviewed. Late-onset LN constituted 53 of 4420 patients (1.2%) biopsied during the study period. Females represented 90.65% of the cohort. Mean age of the cohort was 49.5 ± 7.05 years at the time of SLE diagnosis while its renal presentation was delayed by median duration of 10 months (IQR 3-48 months). Renal failure was present in 28 patients (52.8%) with acute kidney injury (AKI) (28.3%, n = 15) as the most common presentation. On histopathological analysis, class IV was observed in 23 patients (43.5%), crescents were observed in one-third cases and lupus vasculopathy in 4 patients (7.5%). All patients received steroids. Majority of patients (43.3%; n = 23) received Euro lupus protocol for induction. On median follow up duration of 82 months, renal flares were noted in 9 patients (17%) and 8 patients (15.1%) became dialysis dependent. Among 11 patients (21%) with infectious complications, 7 patients (13.2%) suffered from tuberculosis. Infections caused three-fourth of the deaths. Late-onset lupus nephritis is rare and presents as renal failure in majority.

Long turnaround time and poor sensitivity of the conventional diagnostics are the major impediments for faster diagnosis of <i>Mycobacterial spp</i> to prevent drug resistance. To overcome these issues, molecular diagnostics have been developed. They offer enhanced sensitivity but require sophisticated infrastructure, skilled manpower and remain expensive. In that context, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, recommended by the WHO in 2016 for TB diagnosis, sounds as a promising alternative that facilitates visual read outs. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to conduct a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic efficiency of LAMP for the detection of a panel of <i>Mycobacterium spp</i>. following PRISMA guidelines using scientific databases. From 1600 studies reported on the diagnosis of <i>Mycobacterium spp</i>., a selection of 30 articles were identified as eligible to meet the criteria of LAMP based diagnosis. It was found that most of the studies were conducted in high disease burden nations such as India, Thailand, and Japan with sputum as the most common specimen to be used for LAMP assay. Furthermore, <i>IS6110</i> gene and fluorescence-based detections ranked as the most used target and method respectively. The accuracy and precision rates mostly varied between 79.2% to 99.3% and 73.9% to 100%, respectively. Lastly, a quality assessment based on QUADAS-2 of bias and applicability was conducted.

Moreover, it remains difficult to differentiate whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is present in the ocular tissues, elicits a heightened immune response without Mtb invasion in ocular tissues, or even induces an anti-retinal autoimmune response. Gaps in the immuno-pathological knowledge of TB-uveitis likely delay timely diagnosis and appropriate management. In the last decade, the immunopathophysiology of TB-uveitis and its clinical management, including experts' consensus to treat or not to treat certain conditions with anti-tubercular treatment (ATT), have been extensively investigated. In the meantime, research on TB treatment, in general, is shifting more toward host-directed therapies (HDT). Given the complexities of the host-Mtb interaction, enhancement of the host immune response is expected to boost the effectiveness of ATT and help overcome the rising burden of drug-resistant Mtb strains in the population. This review will summarize the current knowledge on the immunopathophysiology of TB-uveitis and recent advances in treatment modalities and outcomes of TB-uveitis, capturing results gathered from high- and low-burden TB countries with ATT as the mainstay of treatment. Moreover, we outline the recent progress of HDT development in the pulmonary TB field and discuss the possibility of its applicability to TB-uveitis. The concept of HDT might help direct future development of efficacious therapy for TB-uveitis, although more in-depth research on the immunoregulation of this disease is still necessary.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

A break in continuity of epithelium due to surgery, trauma or previous infection can lead to deeper invasion of bacteria causing infection. The risk factors for actinomycosis are trauma, caries, debilitation, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Clinical presentation can mimic other pathologies, such as fungal infection tuberculosis, granulomatous diseases, so the diagnosis of actinomycosis is delayed or misdiagnosed. For the definitive diagnosis of jaw actinomycosis, medical history, dental history histopathological examinations and microbiological culture are important parameters. Actinomycotic bacteria are sensitive to antibacterial agents hence chemotherapeutic agents are used for treatment.

Heteroresistance leads to difficulties in drug resistance testing and may adversely affect treatment outcomes. The present study estimated the proportion of heteroresistance among MTB in clinical samples of presumptive drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) patients in Central India. A retrospective analysis of data generated from line probe assay (LPA) at a tertiary care hospital in Central India between January 2013 and December 2018 was carried out. A heteroresistant MTB in a sample was indicated by the presence of both wild-type and mutant-type patterns on an LPA strip. Data analysis was carried out on interpretable 11,788 LPA results. Heteroresistance in MTB was detected in 637 (5.4%) samples. Of these, heteroresistance in MTB was detected in 413 (64.8%), 163 (25.5%) and 61 (9.5%) samples with respect to rpoB, katG and inhA genes, respectively. Heteroresistance is considered a preliminary step in the development of drug resistance. Delayed or suboptimal anti-tubercular therapy in patients with heteroresistance of MTB may elicit full clinical resistance and negatively impact the National TB Elimination Programme.

""Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential to significantly reducing the TB burden."" However, a significant proportion of cases remain undiagnosed and untreated, which plays a vital role in the transmission of the disease and severity of the illness in the community in most developing countries. This study aimed to assess ""the extent of delay in diagnosis and treatment of TB patients"" and to identify the major factors associated with such delays (whether patient or health system-related) among TB patients in Rishikesh. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Rishikesh Town, Dehradun District, Uttara khand, India. Total of 130 newly diagnosed TB patients were recruited as study participants who attended the government hospitals of Rishikesh, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh and S P S Government Hospital, Rishikesh. A universal sampling technique was used in this study. The mean age of the study participant was 36.75 (Standard Deviation (SD), 17.6), and the median age was 34 years. Of the patients, 64.6% were men, and 35.4% were women. The extent of various delays, such as patient delay (median 16 days), diagnostic delay (median 78.5 days), treatment delay (median 4 days), health system delay (43 days), and total delay (median 81 days). The misconception of any chronic disease may lead to a false diagnosis or long treatment for symptomatic relief; the absence of proper diagnostic tests and doctor shopping could be the reasons for the prolonged diagnostic delay. Therefore, by strengthening the collaboration between private and public practitioners in order to meet the expectations of the Government of India to achieve the goals of the ""National Strategic Plan for ending TB"" in India by providing good quality care for all patients.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

We have developed BCG∆BCG1419c, by deletion of BCG1419c in BCG Pasteur, which improved control of tuberculosis (TB) in preclinical models. Here, we compared the capacity of BCG and BCG∆BCG1419c to induce autophagy in murine macrophages, modify c-di-GMP content and transcript levels of BCG1416c, encoding the enzyme responsible for c-di-GMP synthesis/degradation, and of BCG1419c, encoding the phosphodiesterase involved in c-di-GMP degradation. Furthermore, we evaluated proteomic differences in vitro and compared protection against TB produced by a low dose of the HN878-Beijing strain at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We found that BCG∆BCG1419c induced more autophagy and produced different levels of c-di-GMP as well as different transcription of BCG1416c with no expression of BCG1419c. BCG∆BCG1419c differentially produced several proteins, including some involved in interaction with host cells. Vaccination with either BCG strain led to control of bacillary burden in lungs and spleen at 3- but not 6-months post-infection, whereas it reduced pneumonic areas compared with unvaccinated controls at 6 months post-infection. Vaccination with BCG∆BCG1419c delayed progression of lung necrosis as this was observed only at 6 months post-infection. Taken together, compared with BCG, BCG∆BCG1419c increased autophagy, presented different levels of c-di-GMP and transcription of BCG1416c in vitro in a growth-phase dependent manner, modified its proteome and delayed progression of lung pathology produced by a highly virulent Beijing strain.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India

However, the need for daily dosing can lead to nonadherence to the therapy, which can result in the recurrence of the disease. Long-acting parenteral drug delivery systems have the potential to improve the treatment of chronic conditions. These systems use various technologies, such as oil-based injectables, PLGA-based microspheres, and in situ forming gel-based depots, to deliver different types of drugs. The use of long-acting parenteral formulations for the treatment of chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis is a recent development in the field. Researchers are also exploring the use of long-acting parenteral formulations for the treatment of malaria, with the aim of reducing dosing frequency and improving adherence to treatment. This review discusses various aspects of long-acting formulation development, including the impact of the physicochemical properties of the drug, the type of long-acting formulation, and the route of administration.

Newer candidates, such as VPM1002 Δ<i>pdx1</i> (PDX) and VPM1002 Δ<i>nuoG</i> (NUOG), were generated to further improve the safety profile or efficacy of the vaccine. Herein, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of VPM1002 and its derivatives, PDX and NUOG, in juvenile goats. Vaccination did not affect the goats' health in regards to clinical/hematological features. However, all three tested vaccine candidates and BCG induced granulomas at the site of injection, with some of the nodules developing ulcerations approximately one month post-vaccination. Viable vaccine strains were cultured from the injection site wounds in a few NUOG- and PDX- vaccinated animals. At necropsy (127 days post-vaccination), BCG, VPM1002, and NUOG, but not PDX, still persisted at the injection granulomas. All strains, apart from NUOG, induced granuloma formation only in the lymph nodes draining the injection site. In one animal, the administered BCG strain was recovered from the mediastinal lymph nodes. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay showed that VPM1002 and NUOG induced a strong antigen-specific response comparable to that elicited by BCG, while the response to PDX was delayed. Flow cytometry analysis of IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and γδ T cells showed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of VPM1002- and NUOG-vaccinated goats produced more IFN-γ compared to BCG-vaccinated and mock-treated animals.

Subsequently, 13 months after disease onset, the child presented with features of systemic HLH in the form of fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, elevated ferritin, and triglycerides. Primary HLH was suspected, and genetic testing revealed a likely pathologic compound heterozygous variation in the PRF1 gene confirming the diagnosis. We planned a hematopoietic stem cell transplant as definitive therapy, but the child succumbed to an episode of sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. We infer from this case that primary HLH is a great mimicker. A high index of suspicion is required to establish a timely diagnosis. Primary HLH may stay isolated to CNS for months and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all refractory cases of demyelination.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
36874895,Knee Tuberculosis Presenting As Pigmented villonodular Synovitis.,Journal of orthopaedic case reports,2022,Rajesh K Ambulgekar; Akshay Jadhav,"Extra pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) May mimic other diseases in clinical presentation which might be difficult to differentiate and diagnose. Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) may closely resemble tuberculosis of the knee joint. In younger patients, without any other co-morbid conditions TB of knee joint and PVNS in the knee might present with involvement of the isolated joint, with swelling which is painful for long duration with restriction in the range of motion. Treatment of both the conditions differs vastly and delay in the treatment can result in permanent disfiguration of the joint. A male 35 years old having a right knee painful swelling since last 6 months. The thorough physical examination, radiographs, and MRI suggest PVNS but an altogether different diagnosis is made after confirmatory investigations, i.e. Histopathological examination. Clinical and radiological presentation of TB and PVNS can mimic each other . Therefore TB should be suspected specially in the like India (endemic). For confirmation of diagnosis hisptopathological and mycobacterial results are important.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
36852792,Isoniazid Loaded PCL-PEG Copolymer Nanoparticles for Sustained Release Application.,Recent advances in anti-infective drug discovery,2023,Alpana Kulkarni; Priya Betai,"Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major cause of death worldwide, despite possibly curable therapies. Neurotoxicity, optic neuritis, and severe liver damage are side effects of isoniazid, a powerful first-line anti-TB drug. We investigated the use of PCL-PEG copolymer to sustain the release of isoniazid to reduce its adverse effects. In the present work, PCL-PEG copolymer was synthesized and characterized. Isoniazid-loaded nanoparticles (Inp) were prepared using a PCL-PEG copolymer. Furthermore, a 2<sup>3</sup> half factorial design was employed for the optimization of drug and emulsifier concentration in Inp. Full characterization of the nanoparticles was performed in terms of drug loading, entrapment efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, and in vitro drug release. The morphology, FTIR, DSC, and PXRD evaluation of the optimized Batch Inp F13 were studied. Stability was evaluated by storing the freeze-dried Inp F13 at various temperatures. The entrapment efficiency and drug loading of nanoparticles prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation were found to be the highest. The release study revealed that all batches of nanoparticles exhibited sustained drug release (60.26 - 88.59%) for 5 days. The cytotoxicity study conducted on <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>revealed a gradual release of isoniazid from Inp, reaching the maximum (on the 15<sup>th</sup> day) compared to plain isoniazid (on the 4<sup>th</sup> day). At 0.8 μg/mL concentration, the inhibitory activity of Inp F13 was maintained for 15 days, indicating sustained release of isoniazid. The nanoparticles having PCL:PEG in a 95:5 ratio, with 0.5% PVA and initial drug loading of 3 mg, produced the optimum batch. Isoniazid-loaded PCL-PEG nanoparticles allowed controlled (sustained) release of isoniazid.",(tuberculosis[MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (delay OR timeliness OR diagnosis delay OR treatment delay) AND India
